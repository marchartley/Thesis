Although snow-covered terrains have previously received attention in computer graphics, simulating the temporal evolution of glaciers as well as modeling their wide range of features has never been addressed. In this paper, we combine a Shallow Ice Approximation simulation with a procedural amplification process to author high-resolution realistic glaciers. Our multiresolution method allows the interactive simulation of the formation and the evolution of glaciers over hundreds of years. The user can easily modify the environment variables, such as the average temperature or precipitation rate, to control the glacier growth, or directly use brushes to sculpt the ice or bedrock with interactive feedback. Mesoscale and smallscale landforms that are not captured by the glacier simulation, such as crevasses, moraines, seracs, ogives, or icefalls are synthesized using procedural rules inspired by observations in glaciology and according to the physical parameters derived from the simulation. Our method lends itself to seamless integration into production pipelines to decorate reliefs with glaciers and realistic ice features.},

In particular, they are characterized by complex underground networks made of varieties of tunnels and breakout chambers with stalagmites and stalactites. Our method computes skeletons of karstic networks by using a gridless anisotropic shortest path algorithm according to field data of the underground system (such as inlets and outlets), geomorphological features and parameters such as faults, inception horizons, fractures, and permeability contrasts. From this skeleton, we define the geometry of the conduits as a signed distance function construction tree combining primitives with blending and warping operators. Our framework provides multiple levels of control, allowing us to author both the structure of the karstic network and the geometric cross-section shapes and details of the generated conduits.},

We first present a modified Marching Cubes algorithm designed to eliminate choices arising from ambiguities in the original algorithm and its successors in order to facilitate a faster implementation and to simplify the design of a level-of-detail algorithm. The modified Marching Cubes algorithm is extended to operate on voxel data at multiple resolutions in such a way that triangle meshes produced at all levels of detail correctly match geometrical features. We introduce a robust method for seamlessly joining voxel-based terrain meshes of different levels of detail and establish a transition structure that both simplifies the triangulation problem and eliminates the potential for shading artifacts. Finally, we discuss methods for applying texture maps and advanced shading techniques to voxel-based terrain meshes. These methods are designed to be fast and compatible with the widest possible range of graphics hardware across multiple platforms.},

Our hybrid model combines a volumetric discrete data structure that stores the different materials and an implicit representation for sculpting and reconstructing the surface of the terrain. Complex scenes can be edited and sculpted interactively with high level tools. We also propose an original rock generation technique that enables us to automatically generate complex rocky sceneries with piles of rocks without any computationally demanding physically-based simulation.},

The representation is inspired by real geological measurements and presents good trade-off between commonly used inexpensive, but inaccurate, height fields and memory demanding voxel representation. The representation is based on horizontal stratified layers consisting of one material. The layers are captured in certain positions of the landscape. This representation is then discretized into a 2D array. We demonstrate that the classical algorithm simulating thermal erosion (F.K. Musgrave, 1989), can run on this representation and we can even simulate some new properties. The simulation has been done on artificial data as well as on real data from Mars.},

	abstract     = {Terrains are a crucial component of three-dimensional scenes and are present in many Computer Graphics applications. Terrain modeling methods focus on capturing landforms in all their intricate detail, including eroded valleys arising from the interplay of varied phenomena, dendritic mountain ranges, and complex river networks. Set against this visual complexity is the need for user control over terrain features, without which designers are unable to adequately express their artistic intent. This article provides an overview of current terrain modeling and authoring techniques, organized according to three categories: procedural modeling, physically-based simulation of erosion and land formation processes, and example-based methods driven by scanned terrain data. We compare and contrast these techniques according to several criteria, specifically: the variety of achievable landforms; realism from both a perceptual and geomorphological perspective; issues of scale in terms of terrain extent and sampling precision; the different interaction metaphors and attendant forms of user-control, and computation and memory performance. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of possible research directions and outstanding technical and scientific challenges.},

Given an input time varying high altitude wind field, we compute the wind field at the surface of the terrain according to the relief, and simulate the transport of sand blown by the wind.

Such a slope-based representation is height independent and allows a seamless blending of disparate landforms from procedural, simulation, and real-world sources. For output, an elevation model can always be recovered using Poisson reconstruction, which can include Dirichlet conditions to constrain the elevation of points and curves.},

We propose a further enhancement which will extend the range of models that can be easily and intuitively defined with a skeletal implicit surface system. We describe a hierarchical method which allows arbitrary compositions of models that make use of blending, warping and Boolean operations. We call this structure the BlobTree . Blending and space warping are treated in the same way as union, difference and intersection, i.e. as nodes in the BlobTree . The traversal of the BlobTree is described along with two rendering algorithms; a polygonizer and a ray tracer. We present some examples of interesting models which can be made easily using our approach that would be very difficult to represent with conventional systems.},

We present the first solution for the interactive procedural design of coherent waterfall scenes. Our system combines vectorial editing, where the user assembles elements to create a waterfall network over an existing terrain, with a procedural model that parametrizes these elements from hydraulic exchanges; enforces consistency between the terrain and the flow; and generates detailed geometry, animated textures and shaders for the waterfalls and their surroundings. The tool is interactive, yielding visual feedback after each edit.},

There are several methods to generate fractal terrains, but none of those algorithms allow the user much flexibility in controlling the shape or properties of the final outcome. A few methods to modify fractal terrains have been previously proposed, both algorithm-based as well as by hand editing, but none of these provide a general solution. In this work, we present a new algorithm for fractal terrain deformation. We present a general solution that can be applied to a wide variety of deformations. Our approach employs stochastic local search to identify a sequence of local modifications, which deform the fractal terrain to conform to a set of specified constraints. The presented results show that the new method can incorporate multiple constraints simultaneously, while still preserving the natural look of the fractal terrain.},

Further, we develop a filtering algorithm to build a density estimate that allows the deduction of normals from the voxelized model. This is achieved via a dense packing of information using bitwise arithmetic. We demonstrate the versatility of the method by presenting several applications like translucency effects, CSG operations, interaction for particle simulations, and morphological operations. The speed of our method opens up the road for previously impossible approaches in realtime: 300,000 polygons are voxelized into a grid of one billion voxels at > 90Hz with a recent graphics card.},

	abstract     = {Blending is both the strength and the weakness of functionally based implicit surfaces (such as F-reps or soft-objects). While it gives them the unique ability to smoothly merge into a single, arbitrary shape, it makes implicit modelling hard to control since implicit surfaces blend at a distance, in a way that heavily depends on the slope of the field functions that define them. This paper presents a novel, generic solution to blending of functionally-based implicit surfaces: the insight is that to be intuitive and easy to control, blends should be located where two objects overlap, while enabling other parts of the objects to come as close to each other as desired without being deformed. Our solution relies on automatically defined blending regions around the intersection curves between two objects. Outside of these volumes, a clean union of the objects is computed thanks to a new operator that guarantees the smoothness of the resulting field function; meanwhile, a smooth blend is generated inside the blending regions. Parameters can automatically be tuned in order to prevent small objects from blurring out when blended into larger ones, and to generate a progressive blend when two animated objects come in contact.},

Our efficient solution includes both a fast yet accurate deep learning-based estimation of high-order ice flows and a new, multi-scale advection scheme enabling us to account for the distinct time scales at which glaciers reach equilibrium compared to eroding the terrain. We combine the resulting glacial erosion model with finer-scale erosive phenomena to account for the transport of debris flowing from cliffs. This enables us to model the formation of terrain shapes not previously adequately modeled in Computer Graphics, ranging from U-shaped and hanging valleys to fjords and glacial lakes.},

	abstract     = {This paper proposes a 3D model for analyzing the rockfall trajectory within the framework of contact mechanics and rigid body dynamics, focusing on arbitrary shapes of the falling rock and terrain. Firstly, the sphericity and the concavity and convexity are defined to quantitatively describe the overall shape and local appearance of often-observed falling rocks, respectively. A generation algorithm is then proposed to generate falling rock and terrain with arbitrary shapes. The surfaces of the generated falling rock and terrain model are both meshed by triangular elements. A contact searching algorithm as well as a bilinear model for contact collision are presented to solve the interaction between the falling rock and terrain. Validated by available field test data, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach could simulate the four motion modes of rockfall such as falling, bouncing, rolling and sliding, as well as the transition between them.},
