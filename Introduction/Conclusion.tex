% In this thesis we propose novel contributions in the field of procedural environment generation for underwater scenes. We will briefly summarize these contributions then propose future research perspectives.



Procedural generation of virtual terrains has matured over decades, yet user control remains a central challenge. This thesis has addressed this challenge in the context of underwater environments, with particular attention to coral reef islands and broader implications for biology, geology and graphics. The guiding question has been how to support the user in the creation process rather than replace creative intent, while ensuring flexibility, interactivity and modularity.

\paragraph{User-guided learning-based approach} We introduced in \cref{chap:coral-island} a user-guided procedural method for coral reef island generation that combines sketch-based specification of island shape with wind-driven deformation and a conditional generative adversarial network for diversity. This approach avoids reliance on large real-world elevation datasets, achieves training in approximately one hour on procedurally generated data, and enables inference in milliseconds. This method demonstrates how neural expressivity can be harnessed to lift procedural constraints and present a more flexible interface for designers. It is important to note that the use case was simple enough for a neural network as the generation rules are distance-based, meaning that the network may simply learn to create distance maps; more complex scenarii are possibly not as fast to learn.

\paragraph{Semantic ecosystem modeling} \cref{chap:semantic-representation} proposed a semantic, entity-based ecosystem modeling framework based on phenomenological principles. By representing biotic and abiotic elements as symbolic objects with user-definable interactions, this work trades physics and biological fidelity for computation speed. The abstraction permits rule definitions informed by domain insights without committing to heavy simulation, thereby offering a lightweight yet extensible means for environment design across multiple representations. The quality and fidelity of the generation is directly depending on rule definitions, shifting the responsability into the user's hands, which is far from ideal in a user-oriented application.

\paragraph{Particle-based erosion} In \cref{chap:erosion}, we presented a particle-based erosion framework operating on 2.5D and 3D terrain representations. Each particle is simulated independently along its trajectory, so that the process may be halted at any point without yielding inconsistent partial states. This representation-agnostic and parallelizable method permits interactive control of erosion and can be combined with more accurate submodules if higher fidelity is required. The modular design ensures that improvements in flow modeling or material response can be integrated without altering the overall pipeline. Inter-particle interaction removal is a large physical simplification, trading accuracy with simulation time. 

% These contributions share a common insight: user-centric, modular procedural methods can accommodate diverse needs while remaining amenable to extension. Informal consultations with marine biologists have guided the formalization of reef formation principles and ecosystem interactions. Working across graphics, biology and geology has highlighted terminology mismatches and differing standards of precision; nonetheless, this interdisciplinary engagement has enriched the models and underscored the value of consulting non-traditional sources such as expedition reports to capture domain understanding.

% Limitations must be acknowledged. No formal user studies or quantitative metrics have been produced, so validation remains qualitative. Simplifications in physics and biology are intrinsic in the chosen phenomenological and analytic flow assumptions, which favor performance and interactivity over full fidelity. The scope is broad rather than deeply focused in any single subdomain, reflecting an exploratory approach. The modular architecture mitigates these limitations by allowing replacement or augmentation of simplified components with more accurate alternatives when needed, at the expense of increased computation.

% By surveying multiple facets of user-guided terrain generation, this thesis lays a foundation for focused future studies without claiming exhaustive treatment in each area. The thematic experimentation conducted here opens pathways for deeper investigation and integration of more advanced models. This work demonstrates how procedural generation frameworks can be designed around the user, offering both interactivity and extensibility for underexplored underwater biomes and beyond.


\section*{Future work and research perspectives}

Future work and research perspectives span several directions that extend the foundations established in this thesis. These directions aim to deepen the modular, user-centric approach to terrain generation by incorporating recent advances in data-driven modeling, procedural inference, and simulation surrogates. Each perspective addresses a distinct aspect of the pipeline. While technically diverse, these perspectives share a common goal: to enhance user control, reduce reliance on manual tuning or exhaustive simulation, and promote adaptability across creative and scientific domains.



\paragraph{Inverse procedural generation} An interesting direction would be to infer procedural rules from an observed terrain and its semantic elements by inverting the symbolic framework of \cref{chap:semantic-representation}. The aim is to analyze a single scene, and abstract it as \glosses{EnvObj} to hypothesize placement, implicit geometry and interaction rules that could generate similar patterns. Scene analysis involves mapping observed entities and spatial distributions into the symbolic vocabulary. Rule hypothesis then explores candidate constructs, followed by forward simulation to validate and adjust parameters until regenerated outputs resemble the original scene. Once validated, the inferred rules can be used to extend the terrain beyond observed boundaries, simulate temporal evolution, or perform inpainting.

\paragraph{User-data-driven generation} We could develop generative models that learn terrain design style from a limited archive of prior creations of a single user by building on the sketch-based cGAN method of \cref{chap:coral-island} in association with the generation rules infered on the semantic representation of the user terrains. Generating label maps from point, curve and region \glosses{EnvObj} may provide a way to produce a dataset with data generation and data augmentation. Once train, freehand sketching of a label map generates the \glosses{EnvObj} to populate the landscape, which stays conform to prior creations. The challenge is to propose a representation scheme for the cGAN architecture that outputs \glosses{EnvObj}' skeleton and properties.

% the challenge is to define a representation scheme for existing terrain assets (height fields, procedural parameters, semantic annotations) and to construct a style embedding that captures characteristic morphological features. The work must address few-shot learning challenges by leveraging pretrained networks and synthetic data, while preserving the fast training and millisecond-scale inference demonstrated previously. Interactive control remains central: the generative model should expose high-level parameters that allow designers to constrain global shape, ecosystem elements, or erosion patterns, and to revise constraints without full retraining. Evaluation relies on iterative user feedback loops to align outputs with design intent, using qualitative assessments to refine style embeddings and control interfaces. The goal is a pipeline wherein a designer's own terrain archive informs new, stylistically coherent outputs with minimal data and rapid iteration.

\paragraph{Learned erosion model} A final work proposed from this thesis is the learned approximation of erosion from \cref{chap:erosion} to enable rapid terrain aging with controllable fidelity. Provided an initial flow field as a voxelized image and the resulting grid after erosion iterations with varied particle counts, the training of a 3D cGAN or Transformer could result in a learned-based erosion model. If stable enough, this model would enable to interpolate directly on a desired number of particles and wind flow direction. Providing a model for each possible \gloss{EnvObj} of a terrain could be a mean to generate each 3D model plausibly.

% \midConclusion

% The research perspectives outlined above build directly on the thematic contributions and modular philosophy of this thesis. By advancing user-data-driven generation, inverse procedural generation and analytic erosion models, future work can deepen and extend the foundations established in this thesis. Interdisciplinary collaboration remains essential, drawing on expertise in machine learning, human-computer interaction, computer vision, geology, ecology and related fields. The modular abstractions and human-in-the-loop design principles presented in this thesis offer a groundwork for these investigations. Pursuing these directions is expected to yield more robust, flexible and user-centered terrain generation tools that serve both creative and scientific objectives. 




% \section*{Contributions}
% \paragraph{Association of procedural generation with deep learning methods}  Deep learning and machine learning have been expanding domains for the last few decades, and the Computer Graphics community has been brittle to incorporate these fields' methods. Through our work (\cref{chap:coral-island}), we trained a deep learning method in association with sketch-based modeling to improve usability, without replacing the fundamental importance of modeling methods for data-sparse domains such as, in our case, coral reef islands.

% We have seen that this wrapper around procedural modeling can improve performences and interaction, allowing for user inputs with less constraints, and less restrictions. This interface between the complex requirements of a procedural method and the needs for intuitive UI for the user is shown to be easy to put in place, with the illustration of the out-of-the-box pix2pix model. 

% We limit our scope to output 2.5D height fields, but the acceleration of fluid simulations with convolutional neural networks suggests that even the most complex fields may be candidates to this type of associations. That the main challenge for completely including neural networks (NN) in CG works may be the design of intuitive controls as inputs of the NN.


% \paragraph{Ecosystem simulation for terrain modeling} % \paragraph{User-oriented generation}  User Interaction is a whole field of Computer Graphics and is in constant evolution since the begining of computer science. Procedural generation, and more specifically procedural terrain generation, has been relying on random generators and the increase of computation power to produce infinite content or include physical simulations, focusing on automatic generation to produce quantity. More recently, authoring has taken more importance in the field, showing an increasing concern for user-oriented generation over automatic generation, which we may summarize as the desire to obtain quality over quantity.

% In \cref{chap:coral-island} we introduced learning-based methods through the use of cGAN as an interface between curve-based modeling algorithms and drawing-based interaction. The neural network is trained on procedural data that follows user-designed parameters specifically proposed for data-sparse domain, in our case, coral reef islands. We then introduced in \cref{chap:semantic-representation}
