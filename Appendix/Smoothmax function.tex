\chapter{Smoothmax Function}
\label{chap:smoothmax-proof}

\shortAbstract{
    Boolean operations such as union, intersection, and difference are fundamental in logic and have been widely adopted in computer graphics, particularly in Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). In this context, they are used to combine geometric primitives into complex shapes. However, while boolean functions are naturally discontinuous, modern rendering pipelines typically favor smoothness to enable effects such as anti-aliasing, gradient shading, and physical simulation. This has led to the development of smooth operators: continuous, differentiable approximations of boolean functions. The ideal objective is to construct operators that are not only smooth but infinitely differentiable, also known as functions belonging to the class $C^\infty$.

\section{Definition of the \texttt{Smoothmax} function}

In \cref{subsubsec:height-functions-blending}, we introduced the \texttt{Smoothmax} operator $\smoothmax: \R^2 \to \R$ as a smooth approximation of the $\max$ operator, defined with the sharpness parameter $k > 0$ as

\begin{align}
    \smoothmax(a, b) = a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b - a}{1 + e^{-k(b - a)}} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b - a}{1 - e^{-k(b - a)}}
\end{align}

We observe that for $a = b$, the final term becomes undefined due to a removable singularity in the expression $\frac{b - a}{1 - e^{-k(b - a)}}$, potentially introducing a discontinuity. In this section, we demonstrate that this function is in fact continuous on $\R^2$ and is infinitely differentiable, i.e., $\smoothmax \in C^\infty$.

It is evident that the only potentially problematic term in $\smoothmax$ is $\frac{b - a}{1 - e^{-k(b - a)}}$, as the rest of the expression is composed of standard smooth ($C^\infty$) functions.

To simplify our analysis, define the auxiliary function:

\begin{align}
    f(x) = \frac{x}{1 - e^{-kx}}
\end{align}

Then we express
\begin{align}
    \smoothmax(a, b) = a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b - a}{1 + e^{-k(b - a)}} + \frac{1}{2} f(b - a)
\end{align}

To assess the continuity and differentiability of $\smoothmax$, it suffices to analyze $f$ in a neighborhood of $x = 0$, where the apparent singularity arises.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Plotting the function $f(x)$ suggests continuity, with the sharpness parameter $k$ equal to 1, 2, 5, 10 for the curves red, green, orange and blue respectively; although it is initially undefined at $x = 0$.}
    \label{fig:smoothmax-f-plot}
\end{figure}

\section{Continuity: $C^0$}

From \cref{fig:smoothmax-f-plot}, we observe that $f$ appears continuous at $x = 0$. However, directly evaluating $f(0)$ yields the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$. To resolve this, we apply L'HÃ´pital's Rule:

\begin{align}
    \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x}{1 - e^{-kx}} = \frac{g'(x)}{h'(x)}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    g(x) = x, \quad & \quad g'(x) = 1 \\
    h(x) = 1 - e^{-kx}, \quad & \quad h'(x) = k e^{-kx}
\end{align}

Thus,
\begin{align}
    \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{g'(x)}{h'(x)} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{k e^{-kx}} = \frac{1}{k}
\end{align}

Since the limit exists and equals $\frac{1}{k}$, we define
\begin{align}
    f(0) := \frac{1}{k}
\end{align}

This definition removes the singularity and ensures that $f$ is continuous on $\R$. For the case $a = b$, we then have
\begin{align}
    \smoothmax(a, b) = a + \frac{1}{2k}
\end{align}

The complete definitions of the functions are
\begin{align}
    f(x) &= \begin{dcases}
        \frac{x}{1 - e^{-kx}} &, x \neq 0 \\
        \frac{1}{k} &, x = 0
    \end{dcases} \\
    \smoothmax(a, b) &= \begin{dcases}
        a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b - a}{1 + e^{-k(b - a)}} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b - a}{1 - e^{-k(b - a)}} &, a \neq b \\
        a + \frac{1}{2k} &, a = b
    \end{dcases}
\end{align}

We have shown that $f$ is continuous on $\R$, and thus $\smoothmax$ is continuous on $\R^2$, meaning $\smoothmax \in C^0$.
\section{Smoothness: $C^\infty$}

In this section, we prove that $\smoothmax$ is infinitely differentiable. Since it is composed of standard smooth functions and the auxiliary function $f(x) = \frac{x}{1 - e^{-kx}}$, it suffices to show that $f \in C^\infty(\R)$.

We prove this by induction on the number of derivatives of $f$.

\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} \textbf{Base case:} As shown earlier, $f$ is continuous on $\R$ with the singularity at $x = 0$ removed by defining $f(0) := \frac{1}{k}$. Hence, $f \in C^0$.

    \Item{} \textbf{Inductive step:} Assume that $f^{(n)}$ exists, is continuous on $\R$, and is expressible in the form
    \begin{align}
        f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{P_n(x, e^{-kx})}{(1 - e^{-kx})^{n+1}},
    \end{align}
    where $P_n$ is a smooth function of $x$ and $e^{-kx}$. This form arises naturally from repeated applications of the quotient and chain rules:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The denominator gains a factor of $(1 - e^{-kx})$ with each differentiation, hence the power $(n+1)$.
        \item The numerator $P_n$ is a recursively constructed smooth function resulting from differentiation of $P_{n-1}$ and the chain rule applied to $e^{-kx}$. Since $e^{-kx}$ is smooth and all operations preserve smoothness, $P_n(x, e^{-kx})$ remains smooth.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Differentiating $f^{(n)}$ using the quotient rule $\left(\frac{u}{v}\right)' = \frac{u' v - u v'}{v^2}$, we get
    \begin{align}
        f^{(n+1)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{P_n(x, e^{-kx})}{(1 - e^{-kx})^{n+1}} \right)
    \end{align}
    which results in a new expression:
    \begin{align}
        f^{(n+1)}(x) = \frac{P_{n+1}(x, e^{-kx})}{(1 - e^{-kx})^{n+2}},
    \end{align}
    where $P_{n+1}$ is again a smooth function of $x$ and $e^{-kx}$, obtained via product, chain, and sum rules. Importantly, we do not need the explicit form of $P_{n+1}$, it suffices to know it is smooth.

    At $x = 0$, both numerator and denominator vanish, but to the same order. The denominator vanishes to order $n+2$ due to the Taylor expansion:
    \begin{align}
        1 - e^{-kx} = kx - \frac{k^2 x^2}{2} + \frac{k^3 x^3}{6} - \frac{k^4 x^4}{24} + \frac{k^5 x^5}{120} + O(x^6)
    \end{align}
    and $P_{n+1}(x, e^{-kx})$ also vanishes to order at least $n+2$ due to the construction. Thus, any singularity at $x = 0$ is removable, and $f^{(n+1)}$ can be continuously extended there.
\end{Itemize}

By induction, $f^{(n)}$ exists and is continuous for all $n \geq 0$, so $f \in C^\infty(\R)$. Since $\smoothmax$ is built from smooth functions and $f$, we conclude that $\smoothmax \in C^\infty(\R^2)$.

\smallConclusion

Moreover, since $f(x) = \frac{x}{1 - e^{-kx}}$ is composed of analytic functions with a removable singularity at $x = 0$, $f$ is real-analytic on $\R$. Consequently, $\smoothmax$ is also real-analytic on $\R^2$.

\section{Operator's symmetry}
We will briefly prove the symmetry of $\smoothmax$ by showing that $\smoothmax(a, b) = \smoothmax(b, a)$. The case of $a = b$ is obviously true.

Let's note $x = b - a$, and decompose $\smoothmax(a, b) = a + g(x)$. We want to show that for all $a, b$ we have
\begin{align}
    & \smoothmax(a, b) = \smoothmax(b, a) \\
    \iff& a + g(x) = (a + x) + g(-x) \\
    \iff& g(x) - g(-x) = x
\end{align}

By rearranging the function $g$, we obtain 
\begin{align}
    g(x) &= \frac{x}{2} \left( \frac{1}{1 - e^{-kx}} + \frac{1}{1 + e^{-kx}} \right) \\
    &= \frac{x}{2} \left( \frac{1 - e^{-kx}}{(1 + e^{-kx})(1 - e^{-kx})} + \frac{1 + e^{-kx}}{(1 + e^{-kx})(1 - e^{-kx})} \right) \\
    &= \frac{x}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{1 - e^{-2kx}} \\
    &= \frac{x}{1 - e^{-2kx}}
\end{align}


Developing:
\begin{align}
    g(x) - g(-x) = \frac{x}{1 - e^{-2kx}} - \frac{-x}{1 - e^{2kx}}
\end{align}

Let $r = e^{2kx} > 0$:
\begin{align}
    g(x) - g(-x) &= \frac{x}{(1 - e^{-2kx})} \cdot \frac{e^{2kx}}{e^{2kx}} + \frac{x}{1 - r} \\
    &= x \left( \frac{r}{r - 1} + \frac{1}{1 - r} \right) \\
    &= x \left( \frac{1 - r}{1 - r} \right) = x
\end{align}

We shown that $g(x) - g(-x) = x$, resulting in the proof that $\smoothmax(a, b) = \smoothmax(b, a)$ for all $a, b$.

\section{Practical expressions for $\smoothmax(a, b)$ and its derivatives}
\label{sec:smoothmax-practical-forms}

In applications such as shading, soft blending, and physical simulation, efficient evaluation of $\smoothmax(a, b)$ and its first and second derivatives is often required. This section provides compact, implementation-ready expressions for these quantities.

\subsection*{Function value}
\begin{align}
    \smoothmax(a, b) &= \begin{cases}
        a + \frac{(b - a)}{2} \left( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(b-a)}} + \frac{1}{1 - e^{-k(b-a)}} \right) &\text{if } a \neq b \\
        a + \frac{1}{2k} &\text{if } a = b
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

\subsection*{First derivatives}
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial a} \smoothmax(a, b) &= - g_1(a, b) \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial b} \smoothmax(a, b) &= g_1(a, b)
\end{align}

with 
\begin{align}
    g_1(a, b) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{e^{2k(b-a)}\left(e^{2k(b-a)} - 1\right)}{\left(e^{2k(b-a)}-1\right)^2} &\text{if } a \neq b \\
        \frac{1}{2} &\text{if } a = b
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

\subsection*{Second derivatives}
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial a^2} \smoothmax(a, b) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial b^2} \smoothmax(a, b) = - g_2(a, b) \\
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial a \partial b} \smoothmax(a, b) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial b \partial a} \smoothmax(a, b) = g_2(a, b)
\end{align}

where the second derivative of the core function is given by
\begin{align}
    g_2(a, b) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{4ke^{2ka}e^{2kb} \left( e^{2ka} (ka-kb-1) + e^{2kb}(ka - kb + 1) \right)}{\left(e^{2kb}-e^{2ka} \right)^3} &\text{if } a \neq b \\
        0  &\text{if } a = b
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

The expression is algebraically heavy, but all terms are composed of simple exponentials, products, and powers, making it fast and safe to compute in practice, and the redundant components can be cached (in particular $e^{2ka}$ and $e^{2kb}$). At $x = 0$, we have $g_2(0) = 0$ by symmetry and smoothness of the underlying expression.

A $\smoothmin$ operator can be derived directly from the $\smoothmax$ by reversing the sign of the sharpness parameter $k_{\text{smoothmin}} = - k_{\text{Smoothmax}}$.



\section{Comparison with other smooth maximum functions}
\label{sec:comparison-smoothmax}

To evaluate the practical performance of the \texttt{Smoothmax} operator, we compared it with two commonly used alternatives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{LogSumExp}:
    \begin{align}
        \mathrm{\texttt{LSE}}(a, b) = \frac{1}{k} \log\left(e^{k a} + e^{k b}\right)
    \end{align}
    This is a popular smooth approximation to $\max(a, b)$, widely used in machine learning.

    \item \texttt{Smooth Absolute Max:}
    \begin{align}
        \mathrm{\texttt{AbsMax}}(a, b) = \frac{a + b}{2} + \frac{1}{2k} \log\left(1 + e^{-k|a - b|}\right)
    \end{align}
    A symmetric blend of the average and the absolute difference.

    \item \texttt{Smoothmax}:
    \begin{align}
        \smoothmax(a, b) = a + \frac{b - a}{2} \left( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(b - a)}} + \frac{1}{1 - e^{-k(b - a)}} \right)
    \end{align}
    Our symmetric and infinitely differentiable approximation, designed to behave well under chaining and small sharpness variations.
\end{itemize}

We compare these functions across four benchmarks: chaining behavior, sharpness resolution, runtime performance, and aggregation error.

\subsection*{Chaining behavior}

We evaluate each operator by chaining it over $n$ inputs drawn randomly from $[0, 100]$. The true maximum is compared to the approximate maximum, and errors are averaged over 100 trials per $n$. \cref{fig:smoothmax-chained-error} shows that the \texttt{Smoothmax} operator consistently provide an accuracy multiple order of magnitude higher than the Smooth Absolute Max operator, and similar order of magnitude than the \texttt{LogSumExp} operator.

    \caption{Mean absolute error as more values are chained together ($k = 5$).}

%     \label{tab:smoothmax-avg-error}
% \end{table}

\subsection*{Precision and sharpness}

We also test how each function converges to $\max(a, b)$ as sharpness $k$ increases. We fix two very close inputs $a = 1.0000$ and $b = 1.0001$ and sweep $k$ over several orders of magnitude. We see in \cref{fig:smoothmax-sharpness} that for small values of $k$, the \texttt{AbsMax} operator is closer to the ground truth, but as $k$ tends to exaggerated high values, the \texttt{Smoothmax} operator gets significantly more accurate. When fixing $a = 1.0000$ and $b = 1.01$ or $b = 2.0$, \texttt{AbsMax} operator's error becomes higher by multiple order of magnitude, while the \texttt{LogSumExp} and the \texttt{Smoothmax} operators have identical behaviours.

    \label{fig:smoothmax-sharpness}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Runtime benchmark}

To get a rough idea of performance, we measured the average time (in microseconds) for a single call of each function over 10 000 repetitions, using scalar inputs and $k = 5$. Results are presented in \cref{tab:smoothmax-time}. This test was conducted with using Python 3.10 and NumPy 1.25 on a Linux system with a modern multi-core CPU and 14GB of RAM. We note that the \texttt{LogSumExp} function is more time consuming as it contains two exponential componants and a log function, with a risk of overflow that for large values of $a$, $b$ or $k$. On the other hand, the \texttt{Smoothmax} operator contains a single unique exponential componant that quickly fall to 0 for large values of $k$ or difference between $a$ and $b$, keeping it stable (\cref{fig:smoothmax-precision-per-floating-point} presents floating point overflows). 

Fixing $k = 2.0$, $a = 0.0$ and limiting data type to 4 bytes floating points representation, \texttt{LogSumExp} and AbsSumMax overflows at $b = 45.0$, and $b = 355.0$ for 8 bytes representations, while the \texttt{Smoothmax} function does not have limit as \texttt{exp(-k * (b - a))} is simply truncated to 0 as $k (b - a)$ gets large. Moreover, the \texttt{Smoothmax} computation rely on the difference between the input (scaled by $k$) in the exponential operators, while \texttt{LogSumExp} rely on the sum of $e^{ak}$ and $e^{bk}$, which overflow quickly if $a$ and $b$ are both larger than 1.

\end{figure}
\midConclusion

Overall, \texttt{Smoothmax} performs best across the board:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It keeps errors low even when chaining over many values.
    \item It converges smoothly and accurately as sharpness increases.
    \item It is fast to compute and numerically stable.
\end{itemize}

This makes it a practical and robust replacement for $\max(a, b)$ in simulation and graphics tasks where smoothness matters (such as raymarching, as illustrated in \cref{fig:smoothmax-rendered-example}).

\section{Relationship to prior work}

After deriving the formula
\begin{align}
    \smoothmax(a,b) = a + \frac{b - a}{1-e^{-2k(b - a)}}
\end{align}
we found it is algebraically equivalent to QuÃ­lez's "sigmoid" smooth-min function \cite{Quilez2013} under the standard transformation $\smoothmax(a,b; k) = -\smoothmin(-a,-b;k_\text{Quilez})$ with the parameter mapping $k_\text{Quilez} = \frac{1}{2k}$. Accordingly, we do not claim novelty for the functional form. Our contributions are the rigorous smoothness/analyticity proofs, closed-form derivatives with $a = b$ limits, and numerically stable implementations and benchmarks.
