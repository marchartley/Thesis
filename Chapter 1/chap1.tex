This chapter introduces a novel method for procedural terrain generation, which leverages a sparse representation of environmental features to produce landscapes that are lightweight, plausible and adaptable to user desires. The method differs from traditional terrain generation approaches by emphasizing multi-scale user interaction and incorporating expert knowledge to model the evolution of terrain features over time. By representing terrain features as discrete entities, or "\glosses{EnvObj}", the method enables dynamic interaction between these entities and their surrounding environment, represented through continuous scalar and vector fields. The generation process is iterative and allows for user-guided modifications at any iteration, including the introduction of environmental events that can influence the terrain's evolution. The proposed approach is particularly flexible, capable of generating both terrestrial and underwater landscapes with a focus on large-scale plausibility and detailed, localized feature representation. 


% Automated terrain generation is a key component of natural scene digital modeling for animated movies and video games. Many landscapes have been studied and are synthesised with more and more realism. 
% Different processes can be used and combined to achieve these scenes: fractal terrains \cite{Musgrave1989,Prusinkiewicz1993a}, erosion simulation \cite{Cordonnier2023, Mei2007}, manual modeling \cite{DeCarpentier, Guerin2022}, geological simulation \cite{Cortial2019,Cordonnier2017a}, ... The high quality of synthesis for such environment is due to the possibility to observe these environments from many point of views: long-distance gazing, hiking on mountains, remote sensing, aerial imaging, ... 
% Thanks to the quality of the digital modeling, the entertainment industry display often breathtaking land scenes.

% Underwater scenes are rarely created in these media for multiple reasons: these environments are not completely understood and mastered as much as land environments because they are difficult to access, we lack the capacity to see them at a larger scale (unlike mountains for example) and the underlying process that forms these landscapes are much more complex to simulate.

% These limitations cause animated movies and video games studios to avoid as much as possible underwater environments. 

% However, these environments are important for the study of biology, geology, and, by extension, robotics. Due to the complexity, limitations and danger of underwater human operations, underwater robots are more and more used for marine environment monitoring\cite{Maslin2021, Williams2016, Dunbabin2020, Palmer2021}. Yet the validation process of such underwater robot is expensive, with heavy logistic, and it is often  impossible to find the appropriated environment to test the system. Thus, underwater robotics requires simulation capacities, to be able to test the robot's algorithms in very specific environment and conditions. But for now, roboticians are lacking the capacity to test on realistic virtual scenes, and so only test them on synthetic scenarios that do not correlate with real world terrains. For that, they need to manipulate more precisely the characteristics of the underwater environment, at different scales.

% The difficulties to visualize and study the underwater environments on a large scale at the same time as a small scale is an obstacle to the procedural generation and simulation of scenes that are coherent in these two different scales. 
% A solution to this problem could be a bottom-up approach, simulating at the smallest scale the behaviour of all the elements of the environment. Computing such a simulation in order to generate an entire ecosystem is an near-impossible task due to time and memory complexity. 

% The method we propose provides a way to procedurally generate environments on multiple scales without introducing such complexity by using a sparse representation of the environment using \glosses{EnvObj}.
% The \glosses{EnvObj} only have access to local values of the environments to spawn, grow and die. The use of local interaction with environment values removes the need for complex interconnections between all elements of the terrain, providing a parallelisable generation process at large to small scales.
% Defining \glosses{EnvObj} of the terrain as parametric models based on point, curve or region skeletons provides a lightweight representation of the terrain that the user can interact with. The interaction with the simulation process is still a difficult task \cite{Smelik2014}.
% Our method does not aim for a visually realistic generation, but for a plausible terrain depending on geological and biological constraints, guided by the user. Using state of the art modeling of the geometry of the \glosses{EnvObj} of the terrain could achieve realistic results. We illustrate the method through the generation of coral islands and reefs.

% Our main contribution are the introduction of a sparse representation of the terrain elements as \glosses{EnvObj}, the use of fitting functions to incorporate biological rules in the simulation process avoiding physic simulation and an interactive simulation based on geological \glosses{GeoEvent} for underwater landscapes.




% Simulating underwater landscape growth is complex due to the interplay of biological, environmental, physical, geological, and human factors. Our method addresses this complexity by introducing a sparse representation of the terrain elements using environmental objects, defined as parametric models based on point, curve, or region skeletons, which interact locally to spawn, grow, and die. This approach removes the need for complex interconnections, enabling a parallelizable and scalable generation process. By using fitting functions to incorporate biological rules and focusing on geological plausibility, our method enables interactive underwater landscape simulations. The main contributions of this work are the introduction of sparse terrain element representation, the use of fitting functions to simulate biological processes without complex physics, and the development of an interactive simulation framework based on geological events.
