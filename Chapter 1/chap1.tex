Simulating underwater landscape growth is complex due to the interplay of biological, environmental, physical, geological, and human factors. Our method addresses this complexity by introducing a sparse representation of the terrain elements using environmental objects, defined as parametric models based on point, curve, or region skeletons, which interact locally to spawn, grow, and die. This approach removes the need for complex interconnections, enabling a parallelizable and scalable generation process. By using fitting functions to incorporate biological rules and focusing on geological plausibility, our method enables interactive underwater landscape simulations. The main contributions of this work are the introduction of sparse terrain element representation, the use of fitting functions to simulate biological processes without complex physics, and the development of an interactive simulation framework based on geological events.
