   abstract = {The Structural pattern, in the western part of Al Jabal Al Akhdar, reflects inversion during late-Cretaceous-Miocene times, in response to the influence by dextral shear of the Alpine orogeny. It is themed by the formation of NE-SW to ENE-WSW principle displacement(or deformational) zones (PDZs) that confine inside a system of ENE-WSW trending folds and array of secondary faults conformable with the geometry and progressive evolution in wrench tectonic model. These structures are dominated with folds in the Upper Cretaceous and revealed a main factor of brittle structural elements (faults and joints) upwards in the Tertiary sediments. Qasr Libya area exposes wide exposures of Tertiary carbonate sediments and distinctively clarified the main effect of structures on the morphology, distribution and development of karst features. The structural configuration represents a development of concurrent assemblage of WNW-ESE dextral strike slip faults, N-S sinistral strike slip faults and unmappable flower structures and NNW-SSE normal fault within ENE-WSW principle dextral shear zone. The movement within the whole structure induced zones of broken and crushed rock fragments of varying sizes by which the dissolution becomes easier by the surface and underground water. Among the Tertiary sediments are Darnah Formation (Middle-Late Eocene) and Al Bayda Algal Limestone Member (the upper part of Early Oligocene) that display prominent and spectacular different shapes and sizes of karst (lapies, caves and dolines). In Apollonia Formation (Early-Middle Eocene), Al Shahhat Marl Member (the lower part of Early Oligocene) and Al Abraq Formation (Late Oligocene), these features are lacking and essentially represented by bogaz features .Commonly, karst (caves and dolines, in particular)are structurally controlled and formed in the phreatic zone, while the accompanied collapse in the dolines has been taken place in advance stage of the karst cycle (or in vadose zone).},
