\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{chap:modelisation-abstract}
- Methods completely different \\
** Physical phenomena are different \\
** => Simulation/generation methods must be specific for one landscape \\
- Methods are developed at different instants of the thesis work, \\
** We will see different procedural generation domains: \\
*** Analytical solutions (coral islands \#1) \\
*** Deep Neural Networks (coral islands \#2) \\
*** 3D user interaction (karst networks) \\
- Deep Learning tends to replace procedural methods in 2D domain, \\
** But still too complex for 3D models \\
*** (lack of data, lack of research interest for now) \\
** Still requires a lot of data, which, is (while not easy) possible using aerial images, but is way too sparse with underwater landscapes or underground biomes. \\
- We want to control the area in which an element is modeled in the terrain \\
** Because that's how we define them in the previous chapter. \\
** Thus we cannot use simple random noise methods => no bounds \\
*** Only solution is to use falloff maps, but meh... \\
- As such, we want to keep the skeleton of our elements using primitives (points, curves, regions) \\
** => Much easier to add constraints / manipulate primitives in a "procedural generation" way. \\
- Warning: usage of Deep Learning is at the limit of "procedural generation" and is not considered as part of it by the whole community. \\
