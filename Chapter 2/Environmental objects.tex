This chapter introduces a novel method for procedural terrain generation, which leverages a sparse representation of environmental features to produce landscapes that are lightweight, plausible and adaptable to user desires. The method differs from traditional terrain generation approaches by emphasizing multi-scale user interaction and incorporating expert knowledge to model the evolution of terrain features over time. By representing terrain features as discrete entities, or "\glosses{EnvObj}", the method enables dynamic interaction between these entities and their surrounding environment, represented through continuous scalar and vector fields. The generation process is iterative and allows for user-guided modifications at any iteration, including the introduction of environmental events that can influence the terrain's evolution. The proposed approach is particularly flexible, capable of generating both terrestrial and underwater landscapes with a focus on large-scale plausibility and detailed, localized feature representation.

% Representing an environment as a topographic map
% A method that uses new objects, EnvObjs, to represent the landmarks of a terrain
% Our method represents the different landmarks of a terrain using a geometric (as "without 3D repr") representation. To avoid cycles in the interactions between objects, we use the environment as a proxy. EnvObjs are independant, like cellular automata. Each object affects locally the environment by modifying EnvVals. This modifications are applied by the EnvObjs spreading EnvMat around them. They also absorb EnvMat from the other EnvObjs. We can consider that the diffusion is bounded thanks to a decay rate, meaning the system becomes stable after some time. Because it is stable, it is plausible. We break the stability by adding new EnvObjs following \glosses{GenRule}. New EnvObjs are placed in the environment where they may be the most probable, following a fitness function using the EnvVals. Then the shape of the skeleton is defined following a skeleton \gloss{FitnessFunc}. We wait for the environment to stabilize. It can take some time, and some EnvObjs might die (if fitness function fall below 0), but it will converge. The user can guide this process by defining EnvObjs that can spawn. Also, because it is simple skeleton, he can modifie shapes. The diffusion process is deterministic so no abrupt changes in the landscape. Also, the stability of the system can be broken by influencing EnvVals. So user can affect them through \Glosses{GeoEvent}. \Glosses{GeoEvent} affect one or more EnvVal over time, but we reduce the number of evaluation to the begining and end of the \glosses{GeoEvent}. Each EnvObj has a probability of chance to spawn each day, which can be computed as an amount per month, years, etc... (Probability Distribution Function of $p(X) = p^t$).

% Slight introduction
Virtual terrain generators often deliver raw geometry or grids, but field experts need the symbolic cues they draw on topographic or bathymetric maps (canyon heads, reef crests, dune ridges). Topographic maps are indispensable tools for biologists, geologists, or oceanologists (who refer to their sub-sea equivalents as "bathymetric charts"). These maps are displayed in 2D but provide 3D information about elevation (or depth). They can also use symbology to represent multi-scale elements that must remain legible. In cartography, map symbols are defined as geometric primitives such as points, polylines, polygons, and (more rarely) polyhedrons. Map symbols are essential compression devices: they strip away geometric detail while preserving the relationships that matter.

This abstraction helps us grasp the relationship between different features, and can therefore enable the deduction of physical rules in the evolution of a terrain through the process of observation. In fields where full mechanistic modelling is out of reach (earth science, biology, urbanism, ...), the deduction of rules through observation plays an important role in the understanding of phenomena and explication of situations. Consequently, symbolic maps act as a cognitive bridge: they let experts infer governing processes and develop testable hypotheses even when full mechanistic simulation or controlled experiments are impossible. 

In this way, geologists can study the distribution of peaks in a mountain range or the location of soil types in an area (\cref{fig:env-obj_topo-madagascar}), which in turn helps them infer the probable locations of karst networks (\cref{fig:env-obj_topo-karst}), for example. Using the same abstraction tools, a biologist may study the effect of natural or artificial reefs on coastal erosion (\cref{fig:env-obj_topo-coasts}), or understand more clearly the interactions inside an ecosystem. Oceanologists may also deduce, in a similar manner, the formation of canyons and fans from old river systems (\cref{fig:env-obj_topo-canyon}). In short, the same minimalist notation empowers diverse fields to reason about terrain. This cross-disciplinary utility is the key inspiration for the \glosses{EnvObj} representation introduced in this chapter.

%--- AltTextImage R (coastlines) ------------------------------------ 
\AltTextImageR{%
The use of parametric lines representing coasts of islands or continents is common because it is intuitive to understand the concept of interaction using curves. It also shows an easy way to present the evolution of this interaction with respect to time, as the continuous change of shape can be interpreted by our mind as a moving shape, providing a sense of velocity of change (\cref{fig:env-obj_topo-coasts}). While real coastlines are fractal, a representation using a continuous line is sufficient to be able to imagine the real scene. A more detailed representation would however be harder to read, without any significant improvement in interpretability, and would age quickly as the coast evolves. 

Any element, like a coastline, then has an organic evolution over time, just like biological elements that can grow, shrink, and morph continuously. We see that one of the main differences between the evolution of organic elements, like the borders of a forest, and non-organic elements, like the borders of an island, lies in the time scale.

%--- AltTextImage L (Madagascar soils) -------------------------------- 
\AltTextImageL{%
Symbology can be used to represent simultaneously large elements like regions with a specific type of soil, and very small and sparse elements like volcanic peaks or buildings from \cref{fig:env-obj_topo-madagascar}. We can find, on a single map, elements represented in 0D (sparse points, like volcanos and buildings), 1D (curves like plate boundaries and shear zones) and 2D (regions like the sedimentary cover and tectonic plates). 

The geometric shape used to describe an element may vary depending on the scale at which the cartographer wishes to represent it, or depending on the focus of the map. Observatories are presented as single points (0D) in an island-scale map, but could appear as regions (2D) on city-scale maps. Beaches may be represented as curves, points or regions if the objective is to present their distribution, position, or shapes.
}{./geologyMadagascar.jpeg}{Sedimentary distribution over Madagascar island \cite{Pratt2017}}{fig:env-obj_topo-madagascar} 

%--- AltTextImage R (karst) ------------------------------------------- 
\AltTextImageR{%
A combination of multiple disciplines can be represented in a single topographic map to provide context about an area. We can find examples of representations with urbanism, geology, hydrology, and topography mixed together. Every discipline is linked with all others with relative strength. Urban regions are strongly affected by geology and topography, while hydrology is directly impacted by topography. In this example, the karst geology is influenced by hydrology and geology, because karst features develop where limestone and underground drainage coincide. This also means that the presence of karst features can imply the presence (or a high probability of presence) of limestone and underground water flows, without the need to display them on a map. 

Without its 3D representation, a karst expert may be able to visualize in 3D from \cref{fig:env-obj_topo-karst} a possible ground surface around dolines and lapies without additional information.
}{./QasrLibya.jpg}{Geological features distribution of karstic landscape at Qasr Libya, Libya \cite{ElAmawy2009}}{fig:env-obj_topo-karst} 

%--- AltTextImage L (canyon) ------------------------------------------ 
\AltTextImageL{%
The presence of symbols in a topographic map does not imply the presence of an element in the real world. We often encounter indicative symbols like the head and foot of a canyon, or the area affected by an element, which have no real geometry. However, the presence of these symbols bring useful information. The head buffer displayed in \cref{fig:env-obj_topo-canyon} helps explain the deformation of the shelf break line. Looking from the other side, the deformation on the shelf break implies the presence of a canyon head.
}{./PerthCanyon.jpg}{Localization of key parameters of Perth Submarine Canyon, Australia \cite{Huang2014}}{fig:env-obj_topo-canyon} 

Parallelly, terrain artists typically sketch the global shape of the terrain they will model beforehand, such that they can check, before the modeling stage, that the consistency and plausibility of the terrain will hold. Looking at a simplified map before starting the modeling step allows the designer to modify the overall shape of the terrain at a large scale, before the 3D geometry comes into play, generating too many control points or vertices to deal with. Our goal is to offer that same "sketch-first, refine-later" experience in a procedural setting: users should be able to draft a coarse landscape, evaluate its plausibility, then zoom in and iteratively refine features, from a mountain ridge down to an individual boulder, without ever losing global coherence.

As seen in the previous examples, by simplifying surface details we can concentrate more effectively on gaining a deep understanding of the underlying processes that shape the terrain. This deeper understanding allows us to apply the insights to a wide variety of terrain types, facilitating broader and more versatile applications of our knowledge. 

In the context of generation of underwater environments, the elements to consider span several orders of magnitude in size. From a single coral colony to a volcanic island, the use of topographic map lets biologists, geomorphologists, and hydrologists study the evolution of an area. The procedural construction of such landscapes should match the tools that experts use already to stay intuitive. 

The question which leads to our solution is one of multi-scale user interaction: Is it possible to provide an interaction mean for terrain generation allowing the user to interact with a small structure like a rock in the same manner as with a large structure like a mountain?

In this work, we seek a large-scale representation of the terrain to generate a landscape that satisfies their needs while keeping the possibility to apply large modifications. Robotician users need first to create a large landscape that can contain interesting configurations, select a smaller region that has features in a disposition that fits their requirements and then refine it again. In the optic of generating a large scale terrain in which we could focus the generation effort in a certain region, we wished to be able to see a coarse representation that can be computed quickly.

Starting from an initial configuration or imposing conditions on the desired output terrain, the algorithm we propose lets the different terrain features evolve as a multi-agent system in which the user can apply modifications or new constraints on the state of the environment. The resulting configuration is an environment conforming to the constraints given by the user over the distribution of features present in the scene. 

We design our terrain generation method so that it is versatile enough to handle both terrestrial and aquatic environments. This dual capability will allow the method to apply to landscapes above the water level, such as mountains and valleys, as well as to submerged terrains, such as oceanic canyons and coral landscapes. 

Because many geographical terms and computer science terms are deceptive cognates, we therefore try to find middle ground in the naming of our introduced structures to avoid, as much as possible, any ambiguity between the research fields. 

Building on these observations, this chapter contributes:  
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{\Gloss{EnvObj} formalism:} We introduce a sparse, domain-agnostic symbol set (points, curves, regions) that both read continuous environmental fields and write local modifications back to them, creating a closed feedback loop.

    \Item{Analytic field coupling:} A decay-stabilised reaction-diffusion solver for scalar "materials" and analytical deformation of the vector-flow field yield interactive, steady-state updates without heavy fluid or erosion simulation.

    \Item{Multi-scale authoring:} A focus-and-refine pipeline lets users jump from kilometre-scale planning to sub-metre edits while preserving global coherence. We demonstrate this on both coral-reef islands and terrestrial mountain scenes.

\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:env-obj_related-works}

Simulating ecosystems involves a range of modelling approaches, each balancing biological realism and computational efficiency. Broadly, models can treat populations as continuous fields using reaction--diffusion equations, or model each organism individually through agent-based methods. For clarity we discuss existing work in three conceptual families: site-based (grid or tessellation) models, individual-based models, and continuous field models—each emphasising a different balance between local detail and scalability. Site-based models discretise space to model local interactions efficiently. In contrast, individual-based models (IBMs) capture fine-scale behaviours and heterogeneity, often using spatial interaction rules such as fixed-radius, zone-of-influence, or field-based methods. Ecological Field Models (EFMs) bridge these approaches by representing environmental properties as continuous fields influenced by organisms, enabling dynamic feedback between species and their surroundings. These diverse frameworks provide flexible tools for capturing complex ecological processes at varying scales and resolutions.

Our method extends the Environmental Objects framework of \citep{Grosbellet2016}. We lift it from an urban-scene dressing tool to a scale-agnostic ecosystem engine that treats abiotic and biotic entities uniformly and supports user-guided "zoom-and-refine" workflows.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Ecosystem simulation}

Two main philosophies emerge in the literature: modelling dense populations as continuous media \cite{Turing1952} or representing each individual explicitly \cite{Czaran1998}. The former excels in broad predictions; the latter in local realism.

From a large-scale perspective, where billions of individuals are indistinguishable (e.g. grass shoots, bacteria, whole populations), we treat species as continua and borrow reaction-diffusion models from physics and chemistry.

Conversely, when the number of individuals is smaller or the density is low enough, Individual-Based Models become appropriate. These methods treat organisms as agents that sense and interact with neighbours, making decisions such as spawning, growth, and death.

A hybrid family, the Ecological Field Models \cite{Wu1985}, describes how each individual modifies the state of its surrounding environment. Borrowing field theory from physics, they let organisms deposit or absorb continuous "influence fields", creating explicit feedback loops with the environment.

Below, we review the three modelling families (site-based, individual-based, field-based) because our method borrows the sparse symbolic control of IBMs yet retains the continuous feedback of EFMs. We then discuss diffusion models, the mathematical backbone for our environmental fields.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Site-based models}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{grid-based-modeling-teaser.png}
    \caption{Site-based models partition the environment into discrete regions with locally uniform properties. Examples include regular grids, Voronoi cells, and generalised topological maps \cite{Nelson2012,Lemiere2023}.}
    \label{fig:env-obj_grid-based-models}
\end{figure}

Site-based models represent the environment as discrete regions with uniform properties, interacting primarily with their immediate neighbours (Fig.~\ref{fig:env-obj_grid-based-models}). The concept generalises to other tessellations such as Voronoi diagrams or arbitrary graphs.

% ..........................................................
\subsubsubsection{Grid-based models}
Grid-based models represent ecosystems by discretizing continuous space into a regular arrangement of cells, typically squares or rectangles, each containing uniform environmental properties and ecological conditions (\cref{fig:env-obj_grid-based-models}, left). In this approach, each cell represents a spatially explicit patch hosting one or multiple populations, with interactions primarily occurring between neighboring cells. The central ecological rationale for employing grid-based models is their conceptual simplicity, computational efficiency, and ease of representing spatial processes such as diffusion, dispersal, competition, or predation.

Mathematically, grid-based ecological dynamics are commonly described using discrete-time state equations that represent how the state of a cell (such as population density, biomass, or nutrient availability) changes according to its local interactions. A general formulation of these dynamics can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
    N_{t+1}(x,y) = f(N_t(x,y), \Bar{N}(x, y), E_t(x, y))
\end{align}
where $N_t(x, y)$ is the state variable ar cell coordinates $(x, y)$ at time $t$, $\Bar{N}(x, y)$ is the neighborhood of the cell at coordinates $(x, y)$, $E_t(x, y)$ is the explicit environmental factors like precipitation and soil nutrients, and $f$ is the update function that describe the biological changes given a current state, the neighborhood and the environment factors around a cell.

Grid-based models are particularly suited for simulations involving diffusion-like processes or phenomena with clear spatial boundaries. Classic examples in ecology include modeling vegetation dynamics in arid ecosystems, spatially explicit predator-prey interactions, forest-fire spread, and habitat fragmentation effects. Additionally, grid-based representations form the basis for Cellular Automata models, where cells exhibit discrete states (e.g., occupied, empty, burning), updated synchronously according to predefined state-transition rules.

Grid-based models are commonly used due to computational simplicity, easy integration with geographic information systems (GIS), and suitability for parallel computing. They facilitate large-scale ecological modeling by clearly defining spatial relationships and boundary conditions, thus making them practical for exploring broad-scale ecological hypotheses or management scenarios.

However, significant limitations exists as ecological processes may differ drastically at varying scales (e.g. local vs. landscape-level processes). Incorrect spatial resolution of the grid cells can lead to ecological inaccuracies or oversimplifications. Moreover, grid cells assume ecological homogeneity within each cell, which may poorly reflect natural ecological heterogeneity, especially in large cells. Complex ecological interactions, such as asymmetric competition or directional effects, are typically simplified or lost in grid-based discretization. Finally, regular grids impose artificial directional biases (e.g., horizontal/vertical) that can impact ecological interpretations, especially for processes that depend on continuous spatial gradients or isotropy.

\subsubsubsection{Tesselation models}
Tessellation models generalize the idea of grid-based approaches by partitioning continuous ecological space into discrete regions based on proximity rather than regular shapes (\cref{fig:env-obj_grid-based-models}, center). Among these methods, Voronoi diagrams (also known as Thiessen polygons in ecological studies) and their dual, Delaunay triangulations, are particularly relevant and widely applied.

Voronoi diagrams partition a plane based on a set of points (e.g., tree positions, animal territories, or resource centers). Each region in a Voronoi diagram is defined as the set of all points closer to a specific focal point (seed) than to any other point. Formally, given a set of points $\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}$, the Voronoi region $V_i$ associated with the point $p_i$ is defined as:
\begin{align}
    V_i = \{ x \in \R^2 : d(x, p_i) \leq d(x, p_j), \forall j \neq i \}
\end{align}
with $d(x, p_i)$ the distance between the point $x$ and the seed $p_i$.

Conversely, the Delaunay triangulation is the dual graph structure of a Voronoi diagram. It connects points whose Voronoi regions share a common boundary, thereby explicitly defining neighborhoods among entities (e.g., individuals or resource patches). This duality between Voronoi and Delaunay representations provides two complementary perspectives: territorial partitioning (Voronoi) and direct adjacency or connectivity (Delaunay).

In ecological modeling, these tessellation methods have significant implications and applications. Voronoi diagrams naturally represent resource partitioning among individuals or populations, capturing territorial or competitive interactions without the artificial constraints imposed by fixed grids \cite{Castle2006}. For instance, they have been effectively employed in forest ecology to model individual-tree resource competition, where the area of a tree's Voronoi cell directly correlates to available resources and competitive interactions.

The use of tesselated models may become very useful as they adapt to irregular spatial distributions, accurately modeling ecological territories and resource accessibility based on actual entity locations.

They inherently define spatial neighborhoods without arbitrary distances or predefined shapes, enabling more precise representation of interactions among entities.

Unlike grids, Voronoi cells automatically adjust spatial resolution according to entity density, allowing finer resolution in densely populated areas and coarser resolution in sparse ones.

However, Voronoi-Delaunay models also present several limitations and challenges:
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} Dynamic updating of Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations is computationally more intensive than fixed-grid models, especially in large-scale or highly dynamic ecosystems where individuals frequently appear, disappear, or move.
    \Item{} Voronoi models implicitly assume isotropic interactions (competition or resource usage is equal in all directions) and strictly distance-based territories, neglecting directional biases like prevailing winds, slopes, or anisotropic resource gradients.
\end{Itemize}


Generalized topological maps represent ecosystems using abstract spatial relationships and connectivity structures, emphasizing the importance of spatial relationships or interactions rather than explicit geometric positions or shapes \cite{Urban2009}. Unlike grid-based or Voronoi-Delaunay tessellation models, generalized topological maps prioritize topological relationships over exact geometric distances or spatial coordinates (\cref{fig:env-obj_grid-based-models}, right). Formally, these maps can be defined as graphs or networks $G = (V, E)$, where vertices $V$ represent spatial entities (e.g., habitat patches, resources, individuals, or territories), and edges $E$ define ecological interactions, such as connectivity, dispersal pathways, competitive influence, or predator-prey relations \cite{Hamonic2021,Minor2008,Peterson2024}.

By abstracting space into relational networks, these maps enable efficient representation and analysis of ecological processes in scenarios where exact geometry may be unknown, less relevant, or overly complex. They are particularly valuable in modeling metapopulation dynamics, habitat connectivity, or animal movement patterns, where the critical ecological factor is the presence or absence of connectivity rather than explicit spatial positions. Furthermore, generalized topological approaches facilitate integration with network theory, providing tools to analyze ecological resilience, robustness, fragmentation, and connectivity dynamics directly through graph-based metrics (e.g., connectivity indices, centrality measures, or modularity analyses) \cite{Lemiere2023,Gaucherel2012}.

However, the use of generalized topological maps also presents several limitations and ecological assumptions:
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} Removing explicit geometry sacrifices detailed spatial realism, potentially limiting the ability to accurately model distance-dependent ecological processes such as diffusion or continuous dispersal.
    \Item{} Ecological outcomes can be highly sensitive to how vertices and edges are defined, necessitating careful selection or validation of the underlying graph structure to avoid artificial ecological patterns or biased results.
    \Item{} Empirical calibration or validation may be difficult, as topological maps represent abstract ecological relationships rather than measurable spatial distances or tangible boundaries.
\end{Itemize}

Despite these limitations, generalized topological maps remain valuable tools, especially when combined with explicit spatial approaches \cite{Ecormier-Nocca2021} or when explicit geometry is unavailable or unneeded \cite{Duflot2018,Boussange2022}. 

\subsubsection{Individual-based models}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width= .8 \linewidth]{individual-based-modeling-teaser.png}
    \caption{The individual-based models focus the attention on each element of the scene, with interaction with the neighboring entities. Choosing this point of view allows for more precision on the positionning of each tree \cite{Alsweis2006}, but also on the life cycle and geometry of the individuals \cite{Peytavie2024a}. }
    \label{fig:env-obj_individual-based-models}    
\end{figure}

In contrast to aggregated or spatially discrete models like grid-based and cellular automata methods, Individual-Based Models (IBM) explicitly represent each organism or ecological entity as a distinct unit \cite{Crooks2017}. Thanks to increased computational power, IBMs have gained popularity due to their ability to capture individual variability, spatial heterogeneity, and detailed ecological dynamics. In IBMs, each organism is modeled independently, enabling fine-grained representation of processes such as birth, growth, reproduction, mortality, dispersal, and competition, each potentially influenced by local environmental conditions or interactions with neighboring individuals \cite{Chng2013,Peytavie2024a}.

IBM inherently captures the variability and heterogeneity of natural ecosystems, thus providing ecological realism by explicitly modeling individual variability in life histories, behavior, and spatial positioning \cite{McLane2011,Zhang2020}. As such, IBMs are particularly effective for simulating complex ecological processes, including species interactions, competition, predation, dispersal, and responses to spatially heterogeneous environments  (\cref{fig:env-obj_individual-based-models}, right).

To reduce computational costs while maintaining ecological realism, IBMs frequently employ approximations such as distance-based competition methods (e.g., FRN, ZOI, FON), or stochastic processes capturing probabilistic interactions among individuals. Moreover, recent advances have improved the scalability and realism of IBMs by leveraging parallel computing and GPU-based simulations, facilitating large-scale applications.

Hybrid approaches are also common, combining IBM with grid-based or tessellation models to balance computational efficiency and ecological detail. Such hybrids may represent environmental conditions through spatial grids or tessellations (Voronoi diagrams) while explicitly modeling organism-level behaviors and interactions individually \cite{Chng2011a}.

\subsubsubsection{Fixed-Radius Neighborhood}
In the Fixed-Radius Neighborhood (FRN) method, the first appearance of a distance-based method, each tree has a radius inside which we consider that there is shade and competition of nutrients. It two trees' radii intersect, a competition let the strongest tree live while the weakest die (\cref{fig:env-obj_individual-based-models}, left). 

\AltTextImage{

    The computer graphics community represents the FRN constraint by using Poisson Disk Sampling (\cref{fig:env-obj_poisson-example}) or blue noise approximations \cite{Deussen2000} to generate entities as points that does not fall inside any other radius. The algorithm can be accelerated by using a regular grid structure as proposed by \citep{Bridson2007b}: each cell of the grid has a width of $\frac{\radius}{\sqrt{n}}$ with $n$ the number of dimensions (usually $n = 2$). Each point sampled is encoded by the grid cell in which it resides. A cell can only contain a unique point, making it a fast spatial structure for distance computation with other points. Each point added in the grid recursively instantiate new random samples in a spherical annulus of between radius $\radius$ and $2 \radius$. While this method is fast and simple, other methods propose variations on it to add the guarantee of maximal coverage \cite{Ebeida2011} or GPU parallelisation \cite{Wei2008}. However, in the presence of at least two species of different radius, the circle packing problem becomes more complicated and require a larger amount of collision detection, while keeping the spatial indexing method from Bridson's algorithm.

\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Zone of Influence}

    The Zone of Influence (ZOI) model is an ecological method designed to quantify competition among trees by modeling their interactions as gradual rather than binary processes \cite{Czaran1998}. In contrast to simpler binary approaches such as Fixed Radius Neighborhood (FRN), the ZOI model assigns each tree a circular influence zone, typically defined based on measurable attributes like diameter at breast height (DBH), crown dimensions, or species-specific ecological characteristics.

    In this framework, competition between adjacent trees is quantified by calculating the fractional overlap between their influence zones (visible in \cref{fig:env-obj_zoi-scheme}). 

    }{ZOI-Peters2020.png}{ZOI is represented by regions around entities. The intersection between two circular regions (radii) define the competion between the two entities \hide{ (from \cite{Peters2020})}}{fig:env-obj_zoi-scheme}

Mathematically, the intensity of competition $C_{ij}$ exerted by a neighboring tree $j$ on a focal tree $i$ is expressed as:
\begin{align}
    C_{ij} = \frac{ \Area_{\text{overlap}, ij} }{ \Area_{\text{ZOI}, i} }
\end{align}
where $\Area_{\text{overlap}, ij}$ is the area of overlap between the radii of trees $i$ and $j$, and $\Area_{\text{ZOI}, i}$ is the total area of the influence zone of tree $i$. This intersection area can be computed directly with:
\begin{align}
    \Area_{\text{overlap}, ij} = &r_i^2 cos^{-1}\left( \frac{d^2 + r_i^2 - r_j^2}{2 d r_i} \right) + r_j^2 cos^{-1} \left(\frac{d^2 + r_j^2 - r_i^2}{2 d r_j} \right) \nonumber \\
    & - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-d + r_i + r_j)(d + r_i - r_j)(d - r_i + r_j)(d + r_i + r_j)}
\end{align}
assuming $r_i$ and $r_j$ the radii of trees $i$ and $j$ respectively and $d$ the distance between the two centers.

The biological consequences of competition quantified by ZOI, such as reduced growth or increased mortality risk, can be represented through growth-response equations. For instance, tree growth under competition might be modeled as \cite{Das2012,Uriarte2004}:
\begin{align}
    G_i = G_{\text{max}, i} \left(1 - \alpha \sum_{j} {C_{ij}} \right)
\end{align}
with $G_i$ the growth of the tree and $G_{\text{max}, i}$ the maximal potential growth if no competition affect it, and $\alpha$ a sensitivity parameter determining how competition affect the tree growth.


\AltTextImage{

    The ZOI model typically assumes symmetric (isotropic) competition, meaning all trees compete equally in every direction, and the competition effect between two trees is reciprocal if their zones and dimensions are similar. However, ecological realism can be increased by adopting an asymmetric (anisotropic) version of the model, which acknowledges that competition is often directionally biased or size-dependent. For asymmetric competition, the equation is modified by introducing weighting based on differences in tree size or dominance, for example:
    \begin{align}
        C_{ij} = \frac{ \Area_{\text{overlap}, ij} }{ \Area_{\text{ZOI}, i} } f(DBH_i, DBH_j)
    \end{align}
    with $f(DBH_i, DBH_j)$ a function that introduce asymmetry due to a difference in the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the two different trees, modeling the stronger drainage of resources by larger trees, or using $f(h_i, h_j)$ to add model light competition between trees with different heights.
    
}{FON-asymmetric-field-Peters2020.png}{The main inconvenient of methods using individual-based models is that the influence of each entity is supposed isotropic, without taking into account the environmental factors. \hide{(from \cite{Peters2020})} }{fig:env-obj_fon-asymmetric-scheme}

The ZOI model is theoretically rooted in the understanding that trees compete gradually and continuously, rather than abruptly. However, it does rely on simplifying assumptions, such as circular, isotropic zones, homogeneous environmental conditions, and static radii within measurement intervals, which can limit its applicability to certain ecological scenarios involving directional resource gradients or heterogeneous environments (\cref{fig:env-obj_fon-asymmetric-scheme}).

Empirical studies across diverse forest ecosystems have demonstrated that the ZOI approach significantly improves predictions of tree growth, survival, and mortality compared to simpler binary models like FRN. The nuanced representation of competition offered by ZOI models better captures complex ecological dynamics, particularly in mixed-species stands, uneven-aged forests, or structurally diverse ecosystems.

    \subsubsubsection{Field Of Neighborhood}

    The Field of Neighborhood (FON) approach provides an alternative method to quantify tree competition by explicitly incorporating distance-dependent and size-dependent effects of neighboring trees on a focal tree's growth or survival \cite{Berger2000}. Unlike the ZOI model, which uses circular zones and geometric overlaps, FON models typically rely on explicit indices that incorporate both the distance and the relative sizes of neighboring trees, without necessarily defining explicit geometric overlap areas.

    In the FON approach, competition intensity affecting a given focal tree is calculated by summing the competitive effects of neighboring trees, typically as a weighted function of their size and distance (\cref{fig:env-obj_fon-scheme}). 
}{FON-Peters2020.png}{The FON model proposed a smoother version of the ZOI, such that the intersection between the two radii also take into account the distance from the tree trunk. \hide{(from \cite{Peters2020})}}{fig:env-obj_fon-scheme}

A commonly used formulation of competition intensity $FON_i$ for a tree $i$ at the distance $r$ from the trunk is expressed as 
\begin{align}
    FON_i(r) = \begin{dcases}
        1 & \text{for } 0 \leq r < \text{RBH}, \\
        e^{-\curve(r - \text{RBH})} & \text{for } \text{RBH} \leq r \leq R, \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{dcases}
\end{align}
with RBH the radius at breast height (half of the DBH) and $R$ the radius of influence of the tree (usually proposed to be $R = a \sqrt{\text{RBH}}$ given a scaling parameter $a$) and $\curve$ an attenuation coefficient, defined for each species. 


\AltTextImage{
    The overall competition at any point of space may now be described as:
    \begin{align}
        F(x, y) = \sum_{i} {FON_i(x, y)}
    \end{align}

    Now the competition percieved by a tree $i$ is the average of all $FON$ around its area $A$ (and symbolising $A' = \Area_{\text{overlap}, ij}$):
    \begin{align}
        F_A^i = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{j \neq i}{ \int_{A'}{FON_j(x, y) \, da'} }
    \end{align}

}{FON-scheme-Berger2000.png}{The evaluation of the FON value at any point is the simple accumulation of individual fields.}{fig:env-obj_fon-compute-scheme}
Unlike the ZOI method, the FON model does not assume a hard boundary around each tree, instead explicitly capturing a smooth decline in competitive impact with increasing distance. It also inherently accommodates asymmetric competition, since larger and closer neighbors exert disproportionately stronger competitive influences than smaller or more distant trees (\cref{fig:env-obj_fon-compute-scheme}).

The FON method does not rely explicitly on geometric overlap and is thus flexible and particularly useful in heterogeneous forests. However, in order to capture the self-thinning property of silviculture \cite{Makowski2019} satisfying $ W = \curve N^{-\frac{3}{2}} $ (with $W$ the average biomass of an individual, $N$ the density and $\curve$ a constant) \cite{Westoby1984}, the generation of the ecosystem should be iteratively simulated with small time steps \cite{Alsweis2005}, which is computationally expensive. Instead of simulating the full growth model of vegetation, most ecosystem generation algorithms focus on the distribution of the elements of the terrain, abstracting the competion into distance function deformations or statistical optimization. 

\AltTextImage{
    By designing non-monotonous field functions around trees, an emergence of different behaviour can appear. \cite{Lane2002} proposed to apply a "deformation kernel" on the distance function, resulting in a larger variety of patterns like the clustering of bushes and the competition of larger trees (\cref{fig:env-obj_kernels-Lane2002}, top left). From this idea, the definition of deformation kernels for each pair of species (\cref{fig:env-obj_kernels-Lane2002}, top right, with kernels for two species) allows the system to include the ecological interaction between the different species in the terrain. As a result, the simulation of the ecosystem can introduce intra-species clumping while keeping inter-species segregation.

}{kernel-matrices-Lane2002.png}{The deformation of neighborhood kernels enables the modelling of different behaviour for species and inter-species interactions}{fig:env-obj_kernels-Lane2002}

\AltTextImage{
    On the other hand, learning the spatial distribution of distances between individuals from examples can be used as a statistical metric to introduce interactive tools for ecosystem generation \citep{Emilien2015a} (\cref{fig:env-obj_worldbrush-Emilien2015}). In this work, given a user-provided example, the system learns the parameters such as the histogram of distances inter- and intra-species from one region and reproduce these distribution in another regions. This method then does not limit to trees, but may include any scene element like houses and roads, as well as the integration of other metrics than distances such as the terrain slope.
}{worldbrush-Emilien2015.png}{Using statistical distribution from an input terrain, \cite{Emilien2015a} resynthesize a different terrain with similar distributions. }{fig:env-obj_worldbrush-Emilien2015}

While the FON model provides a biologically detailed representation of competition, its computational complexity makes it significantly more challenging to implement in large-scale simulations. Unlike the ZOI model, which relies on predefined geometric overlaps that can be calculated efficiently, the FON approach requires integrating a continuously decaying competition function over an arbitrary area of influence. This necessitates evaluating the function at multiple points across overlapping zones, increasing computational demand. Moreover, the additive nature of FON, where each tree contributes to the total competition field at every spatial point, further exacerbates the cost, scaling poorly in dense forest stands. The necessity of numerical integration or spatial discretization makes FON computationally expensive compared to ZOI, which only requires simple geometric calculations. Consequently, while FON is useful for small-scale or highly detailed ecological studies, it is generally impractical for large-scale forest simulations.



\subsubsection{Ecological Field models}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \autofitgraphics[width = .8\linewidth]{ecological-fields-example-shade-Wu1985.png, ecological-fields-example-water-Wu1985.png, ecological-fields-example-nutrients-Wu1985.png}
    \caption{Ecological Field models represents the environment as a mathematical function where environmental properties like humidity, shade and nutrients are seen as distinct fields (in the figure, respectively from left to right). }
    \label{fig:env-obj_ecological-field-models}    
\end{figure}

Modeling ecosystems requires a careful balance between biological realism and computational efficiency, especially when simulating large-scale environments. Traditional ecological models fall into two primary categories: Site-Based Models and Individual-Based Models, each with distinct advantages and limitations.

Site-Based Models discretize the environment into discrete regions, making them efficient for large-scale simulations but limited in their ability to represent smooth, continuous interactions. On the other hand, Individual-Based Models explicitly simulate each organism as an independent entity, allowing for detailed biological behavior and interactions, but quickly becoming computationally expensive when dealing with large populations.

While these approaches have been successfully used in various ecological studies, many real-world ecological processes do not fit neatly into a discrete grid or a set of independent agents. Instead, they operate in a continuous spatial domain, where organisms interact with smooth environmental gradients rather than discrete neighbors. For example, the competition for light and nutrients is not limited to the direct neighbors.

To address these challenges, Ecological Field Models (EFMs) provide an alternative framework where environmental properties are represented as continuous spatially explicit fields \cite{Wu1985}. Rather than defining interactions through direct contact (as in IBMs) or discrete adjacency (as in SBMs), EFMs describe how organisms modify and respond to smooth environmental gradients \cite{Chng2011b,Seidl2012}.

From a computer graphics perspective, EFMs share similarities with techniques used in Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). Just as SDFs encode geometric influences in a continuous field, EFMs encode ecological influences, allowing for more realistic ecosystem simulations.

EFMs are based on the fundamental idea that organisms are not isolated agents but rather integral components of their environment, influencing and being influenced by it in a spatially explicit manner (\cref{fig:env-obj_ecological-field-models} represent the effect of multiple vegetation entities on the humidity, shade and nurtient fields of the environment). The core ecological principles behind EFMs include two keypoints:
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{The continuous organism-environment interactions:} Organisms modify their surroundings in ways that extend beyond their immediate location.    Environmental factors such as soil nutrients, water availability, light exposure, and chemical signals influence other species gradually across space.
    \Item{The environmental fields influence the organism's growth and behaviour:} Species respond to spatially varying gradients rather than direct neighbor-based interactions, which we can see with phototropism guiding the growth of plants towards higher light availability areas \cite{Pirk2012} or the foraging strategy that develop roots of trees toward nutrient-rich soils \cite{Li2023}. 
\end{Itemize}

The combination of these two principles creates naturally feedback loops that are explicitly modeled, allowing a more realistic representation of ecological interactions compared to static environmental assumptions in traditional models.





EFMs provide a continuous representation of environmental factors, bridging the gap between grid-based and individual-based models by modeling smooth ecological gradients, instead of forcing interactions into discrete cells. This method allows organisms to influence and respond to fields dynamically, while providing a scalable framework that avoids the computational explosion of tracking every individual separately.


While EFMs provide a biologically grounded approach to modeling spatial interactions, their implementation requires a robust mathematical framework to define how organisms modify and respond to environmental fields. 





An ecological field represents a spatially varying environmental property across a landscape. Mathematically, we can define a $n$-dimensional ecological field as a scalar field:
\begin{align}
    F(\p) : \R^n \to \R
\end{align}

Any organism in the scene has an influence on the ecological fields through "influence functions" $K$. These functions describe how an organism's presence affects its surroundings. We can then evaluate the ecological field with $N$ entities:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:env-obj_eco-field-computation}
    F(\p) = F_0(\p) + \sum_{i=0}^{N}{K_i(\p)} 
\end{align}
with $F_0(\p)$ the baseline environmental state.




The primary challenge in computer graphics is how to efficiently store, sample, and modify continuous environmental fields. Since EFMs define spatially varying properties, they require a structured representation that balances accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

Several methods exist for implementing spatially explicit fields in graphics:
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} A common approach is to discretize the environment into a regular 2D or 3D grid, where each cell stores a value corresponding to an ecological property, such as soil moisture, nutrient concentration, or shading intensity. This approach has the advantage of efficient lookup and updates, and GPU compatibility at the cost of memory usage and precision loss. 

    \Item{} Rather than storing explicit values at discrete locations, ecological fields can be defined using procedural functions that are evaluated dynamically. This approach is particularly relevant in procedural terrain and vegetation generation, where continuous field functions determine environmental parameters. A Signed Distance Field (SDF), frequently used in raymarching and volumetric rendering, can be adapted for EFMs by encoding environmental influence functions. This approach enables a theoretical infinite precision for a compact memory footprint at the expense of high computational demand.
\end{Itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Environmental Objects}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .8 \linewidth]{env-objs-Grosbellet2016.png}
    \caption{The Environmental Objects framework \cite{Grosbellet2016} presents a practical methodology for integrating spatially explicit environmental interactions into procedural modeling. The Environmental Objects concept aligns closely with EFMs, providing a computationally feasible way to embed field interactions into simulated ecosystems.}
    \label{fig:env-obj_teaser-grosbellet2016}
\end{figure}

The Environmental Objects system of \citep{Grosbellet2016} attaches scalar fields (heat, humidity, occlusion, ...) to scene assets so that snow, leaves or soot accumulate plausibly. Although conceived for urban set dressing, the idea is strikingly similar to EFMs: objects emit and sense continuous fields and update geometry accordingly.

Our work adopts the same "fields-attached-to-objects" view but turns it into a bi-directional simulator: objects do not only read fields to change appearance, they also decide where and whether they should exist, creating an emergent distribution of terrain features.


The Environmental Objects' method presents a hierarchical framework for authoring procedural scenes by extending objects (assets) with environmental fields that control their appearance and interaction with the virtual environment (\cref{fig:env-obj_teaser-grosbellet2016}). This work tackle the main problem with the modeling an urban scene, which is finding a balance between generating and editing a large scene in interactive time and the integration of small-scale details in coherence with the global environment: 
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} Objects in a virtual scene dynamically adjust their appearance based on surrounding scalar fields, allowing for realistic procedural effects such as snow deposition, leaf accumulation, and icicle formation. Unlike global simulations, which are computationally demanding, this model uses local environmental fields to procedurally generate details without requiring extensive physics-based calculations.
    \Item{} Users can modify environmental parameters, such as temperature fields, to influence scene aesthetics in an intuitive and predictable manner. The model enables scene composition through level of details using object groupings, optimizing the computation of large-scale environments while maintaining local control over environmental interactions.
\end{Itemize}
By employing skeletal implicit primitives and procedural blending techniques, the framework enables the efficient simulation of environmental changes while allowing for real-time scene modifications. 

In this method, each 3D model can be associated with "procedural effects", which regroup scalar fields representing changes in the environment. These fields are defined using skeleton-based implicit primitives, allowing to change the environment properties along a path instead of only using points like the initial EFM. This enables the system to represent for example the diffusion of heat around a pipe, which is not possible with the later. The computation of an environment property is then an agglomeration of all the scalar fields associated to the given property. The authors propose to compute the all scalar fields, like the heat field $\theta$, at any position $\p$ by the accumulation of objects' fields, in a similar manner as \cref{eq:env-obj_eco-field-computation}: 
\begin{align}
    \theta(\p) = \theta_0(\p) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}{ \theta_i(\p)}
\end{align}
and the occlusion field $\alpha$ as the product of all objects' occlusion fields:
\begin{align}
    \alpha(\p) = \alpha_0(\p) \prod_{i=1}^{n}{\alpha_i(\p)}
\end{align}
assuming $\theta_0$ and $\alpha_0$ to be global scalar fields for temperature and shade, symbolising the baseline environmental state in the ecological domain.

\AltTextImage{
    Using the field values, the system instantiates small details like leaves by sampling the space with candidate "anchor positions". If the field values satisfy certain conditions at the anchor position $\p_i$, the small scale objects can be instantiated at this position (for example, for leaves: $\alpha(\p_i) l(\p_i) < d_i$ using the occlusion field $\alpha$, the leaves deposition field $l$ and the distance of the anchor position to the depositing surface $d_i$ as shown in \cref{fig:env-obj_leaves-instances}). This method can then be easily extended to modify the geometry or texture of the object based on the field values like the heat field or the humidity field, to manually move or rotate each of the objects, or even integrate user-defined density fields to populate entangled details on the ground \cite{Guerin2016}. 
}{EnvObjs-leaves-instances-Grosbellet2016.png}{Leaves are instanced if the fields are sufficient and the geometry and texture are altered depending on the environment}{fig:env-obj_leaves-instances}

\AltTextImage{
    On the other hand, the geometry of large objects can be altered using the scalar fields. The authors present a simulation of snow deposition on the objects by displacing the vertices $i$ in the direction of the normals $\vec n_i$ by an amount depending on the environment (\cref{fig:env-obj_snow-Grosbellet2016}):
    \begin{align}
        \p_i' = \p_i + \left( \alpha(\p_i) s(\p_i) g(d(\p_i)) - \theta(\p_i) \right) \vec n_i
    \end{align}
    with $s$ the "snow field", and $g$ a snow elevation function based on the distance between the original vertex and the border of the mesh.
}{EnvObjs-snow-Grosbellet2016.png}{Snow deposition is a displacement of vertices along the normals of the mesh}{fig:env-obj_snow-Grosbellet2016}

\AltTextImage{
    In addition to the EFM framework, the environmental effects from environmental objects are not limited by points geometry as the scalar functions may use a spline primitive or be extended to volume primitives (\cref{fig:env-obj_heat-field-effect}). Translated to the ecological domain, this methodology extends the EFM as the inclusion of water bodies, essential for realistic vegetation simulation, can be taken into account by considering environmental effects from rivers and lakes which are often modeled as splines and regions in 3D modeling \cite{Emilien2015,Genevaux2013,Genevaux2015}.
}{env-obj-fields-heat-Grosbellet2016.png}{The heat field produced by a pipe uses a distance function from a line instead than a single point in space.}{fig:env-obj_heat-field-effect}

The Environmental Objects method can be seen as a variant of the EFM due to their high reliance on the idea of fields and environmental effects of each element on the environment, even if the purposes of each method are opposed: one tend to model the environment properties given the elements present while the other aims at altering the geometry of a scene given the elements in the scene, regardless to their biological nature. However, the convergence of these approaches suggests possibilities for cross-disciplinary innovation. The integration of ecological dynamics into procedural modeling could lead to more adaptive virtual environments that respond realistically to environmental changes, while procedural techniques could enhance ecological simulations by improving scalability and visualization.

The conceptual parallels between these models suggest potential areas for cross-disciplinary application. Insights from EFM could inform procedural content generation, enabling more realistic and adaptive virtual ecosystems by incorporating agent-based dynamics, ecosystem succession models, and time-dependent environmental changes. Conversely, procedural modeling techniques from computer graphics could enhance ecological simulations, improving visualization, scalability, and user interactivity in landscape ecology and biodiversity modeling. 

The original EFMs work effectively for static environmental conditions, but many real-world ecological processes involve dynamic, time-dependent changes. For instance, soil moisture depletes over time, plant growth alters shading conditions, and chemical scent trails decay. By integrating biologically inspired feedback loops, procedural generation could extend beyond static environmental effects, enabling simulations of growth, decay, and species interactions \cite{Okubo2001,Wojtek2022}. To extend Environmental Objects beyond static environmental representations, we turn to reaction-diffusion models, which provide a mathematical foundation for modeling time-dependent field interactions used in ecological simulations. 





\subsection{Diffusion models}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width= .8 \linewidth]{diffusion-example-Okubo2001.png}
    \caption{The diffusion model describe the spread, motion, and evolution of a chemical, population or physical property over time. \cite{Okubo2001}.}
    \label{fig:diffusion-model-teaser}    
\end{figure}

Reaction-diffusion equations, popularised by Turing \cite{Turing1952}, combine local growth/decay with spatial spread. They underpin models of vegetation patterns, invasive species fronts, or nutrient flows \cite{Cosner2008}. For our purpose they serve as analytic update rules whose steady state can be reached without time-marching every intermediate step.

% Reaction-diffusion models are fundamental tools in mathematical biology and ecology, providing insights into the complex patterns observed in natural ecosystems. These models combine chemical or biological reactions (reaction) with movement through space (diffusion) to describe processes such as population dynamics, infectious disease spread, and ecological invasions \cite{Cosner2008}.

% Initially developed to explain phenomena in chemistry and physics, reaction-diffusion models have been adapted to ecological contexts to simulate scenarios where organisms interact with each other and their environment over space and time. The application of these models in ecology helps in understanding how patterns of distribution and abundance arise, how they persist, and how they might change under various environmental pressures.

% The concept of reaction-diffusion was initially introduced in the early 20th century by mathematician Alan Turing explored how non-uniform patterns emerge through mechanisms of chemical reaction and diffusion in \citep{Turing1952}. Turing's theories laid the groundwork for understanding pattern formation in biological systems, including those seen in animal coats and developmental processes.

% The adaptation of reaction-diffusion models to ecological contexts began several decades later as ecologists camne to explain spatial phenomena such as the spread of invasive species, the maintenance of species diversity, and the formation of vegetation patterns. These models provided a mathematical framework to simulate and predict the dynamics of complex biological systems influenced by both local interactions and spatial movement.

Reaction-diffusion models describe the spatial and temporal evolution of populations, chemicals, or other ecological entities that interact (reaction) and spread (diffusion) through a medium (\cref{fig:diffusion-model-teaser}). These models are widely used in ecosystem simulations to understand population dynamics, species dispersal, disease spread, and spatial pattern formation in ecological systems.

In the context of ecology, a reaction-diffusion model typically represents:
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} Reaction: Local changes in population density due to birth, death, predation, or competition.
    \Item{} Diffusion: Movement of individuals or species across space due to random dispersal or environmental factors.
\end{Itemize}
These models help ecologists predict how populations evolve over time and across space, providing insights into species survival, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability.

The classical reaction-diffusion equation is expressed as:

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:env-obj_classic-reaction-diffusion}
    \frac{\partial u (x, t)}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 u(x, t) + R(u)
\end{align}

where $u(x,t)$ represents the population density (or concentration of a substance) at position $x$ and at time $t$, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, determining the rate of spatial spread. $\nabla^2 u$ is the Laplacian operator, representing diffusion across space and $R(u)$ is the reaction term, which models growth, decay, or interactions between species.

\subsubsection{Diffusion term}
Diffusion is a fundamental process in ecological modeling that describes how individuals or substances spread across space due to random movement or environmental influences. In ecosystems, diffusion can model species dispersal, nutrient transport, disease spread, and invasive species expansion.

In mathematical models, diffusion is typically represented as a term in partial differential equations that governs how population densities change over time and space. While many ecological models assume isotropic diffusion (movement occurs equally in all directions), anisotropic diffusion provides a more realistic representation of species movement in structured or heterogeneous landscapes.

However, when diffusion is anisotropic, the diffusion coefficient varies depending on direction, and we must generalize the equation (\cref{eq:env-obj_classic-reaction-diffusion}) by introducing a diffusion tensor $\tensor{D}$ \cite{Ramos2024}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:env-obj_reaction-diffusion}
    \frac{\partial u (x, t)}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (\tensor{D} \nabla u(x, t)) + R(u)
\end{align}

The tensor $\tensor{D}$ can now encompass the effect of relief and environmental factors like wind and currents in the spread of a species. When diffusion is isotropic, $\tensor{D} = D\tensor{I}$, reducing the equation to the classic isotropic form.

Anisotropic diffusion is particularly useful in ecological modeling where movement rates are not uniform due to environmental structures or organism behavior. For example, wind influences the spread of pollen, seeds, and insect populations, leading to anisotropic diffusion. Similarly, marine organisms or pollutants diffuse anisotropically in ocean currents.
Invasive species may spread preferentially along corridors such as rivers or roads, causing asymmetric diffusion. In ecosystems where microorganisms move in response to chemical gradients (chemotaxis), anisotropic diffusion better models movement patterns.

We may generalize the reaction-diffusion equation to account for both internal (density, species interaction, ...) and external (environmental factor, relief, seasonality, ...) influences on diffusion by slightly rewriting \cref{eq:env-obj_reaction-diffusion}:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (\tensor{D(*)} \nabla u) + R(u)
\end{align}
where $\tensor{D(*)}$  is a diffusion tensor dynamically defined by any relevant internal or external property of the system. For example:
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} A density-dependent diffusion can be expressed as $\tensor{D(*)} = \tensor{D} u^m$, allowing for crowding or dispersal-limited movement \cite{Zhu2023}.
    \Item{} A seasonal dispersal effect can be incorporated as $\tensor{D(*)} = \tensor{D} (1 + A cos(\omega t) )$, where dispersal varies cyclically over time \cite{Katriel2021}.
    \Item{} A spatially varying diffusion may be defined as $\tensor{D(*)} = \tensor{D} f(x)$, such as the patchy diffusion formulation used in metapopulation models \cite{Czaran1998}:
    \begin{align}
        \tensor{D(*)} = \tensor{D} \begin{dcases}
            D_1&, x \in \text{habitable patch} \\
            D_2&, x \in \text{hostile patch}
        \end{dcases}
    \end{align}
    \Item{} An anomalous diffusion like the inclusion of Lévy flight term, incorporating random long distance jumps can be expressed as $\tensor{D(*)} = \tensor{D} u^m + \noise L(t)$ \cite{Humphries2014,Chechkin2008}.
\end{Itemize}

This generalized form enables the integration of anisotropic effects, landscape heterogeneity, and adaptive movement behaviors within reaction-diffusion models, making it highly applicable to ecological and biological systems.

\subsubsection{Reaction term}
In physics and chemistry, the reaction $R(u)$ term describes how substances are produced or consumed in a system. Some common reaction formulations include:

\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} Linear reaction terms (exponential growth with $\lambda > 0$ or decay $\lambda < 0$) as in the radioactive decay formulation:
    $$ R(u) = \lambda u $$
    \Item{} Second-order reactions, usually found in chemical reactions between two molecules:
    $$ R(u, v) = \alpha u v$$
    \AltTextImage{
        \Item{} Turing pattern-forming systems proposed by Alan Turing to explain stripe and spot formations in animal coat patterns and chemical reactions \cite{Turing1952,Shoji2002}
        $$ R(u, v) = \begin{dcases}
            f(u, v) & \text{(Activator)} \\
            g(u, v) & \text{(Inhibitor)}
        \end{dcases}$$
    }{turing_patterns.png}{Turing patterns on animals}{fig:env-obj_turing-pattern}
\end{Itemize}

On the other hand, in ecology, the reaction term models population growth, competition, predation, and ecosystem interactions \cite{Brauer2012}. Some of the most important ecological reaction terms are:
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{} The logistic growth, that describes a single species population growth in a limited-resource environment, is defined with a growth rate $r$ and a carrying capacity $K$ \cite{Verhulst1844}:
    $$ R(u) = r u \left( 1 - \frac{u}{K} \right)$$
    \Item{} The Lotka-Volterra competition model, that describe the trophic interactions between two or more species, for which the reaction-diffusion equations take into account each other species:
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} = r_i u_i \left( 1 - \frac{\sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij} u_j}{K_i} \right)
    \end{align}
    with $N$ representing the number of species and $a_{ij}$ the interaction coefficient (how strongly the species $u_j$ inhibit the species $u_i$). \\
    This formulation can also be rewritten in a vectorized form as the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation:
    \begin{align}
        \tensor{f} = \tensor{r} - \tensor{A} \tensor{u}
    \end{align}
    where $\tensor{f} = (f_1, f_2, ..., f_N)^\intercal$ represents the per capita growth rates of all species, $\tensor{r} = (r_1, r_2, ..., r_N)^\intercal$ is the intrinsic growth rate vector, $\tensor{u} = (u_1, u_2, ..., u_N)^\intercal$ is the species population vector and $\tensor{A}$ is the interaction matrix, with elements $a_{ij}$ describing the effect of species $j$ on species $i$.
    
    Since population growth depends on the per capita growth rate, the full population dynamics equation follows:
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial \tensor{u}}{\partial t} = \tensor{u} \circ \tensor{f}
    \end{align}
    where $\circ$ represents the element-wise product, ensuring that each species' growth depends on both its population size and its per capita growth rate.
\end{Itemize}


\subsubsection{Advection}
In vegetation ecosystem modeling, advection refers to the directed transport of biological or environmental variables under the influence of external forces such as wind, water flow, or slope. Unlike diffusion, which describes random movement, advection introduces a preferred direction of transport, significantly influencing ecosystem dynamics \cite{Burger2020}. 

Mathematically, the advection-diffusion-reaction equation (or "scalar transport equations" \cite{Baukal2000}) extends the classical reaction-diffusion model by adding a velocity field $\field{v}$ that governs directed movement:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \field{v} \cdot \nabla u = \nabla \cdot \left( \tensor{D} \nabla u \right) + R(u)
\end{align}

In physics, the transport of a property like heat is coupled by the diffusion process, and the advection term $\field{v} \cdot \nabla u$ may be incorporated in the diffusion coefficient $\tensor{D}$ to form the "convection term". In this work we will seperate the advection term and the diffusion term for clarity.

Wind is a major dispersal mechanism for many plant species, affecting seed distribution, plant competition, and biodiversity. The dispersal efficiency of seeds and pollen depends on wind velocity, turbulence, and interactions with terrain features. In flat landscapes, wind disperses seeds relatively uniformly; however, in complex terrains, wind speed and direction are influenced by topography, vegetation cover, and atmospheric conditions. Wind channeled through valleys may enhance seed deposition in lowland areas, while mountain ridges and abrupt elevation changes can create wind shadows, reducing dispersal effectiveness.

The dispersal of seeds can be modeled using a advection-diffusion equation:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + \field{v} \cdot \nabla S = \nabla \cdot (\tensor{D}_s \nabla S) - \lambda S
\end{align}
with $S(x, t)$ the seed density at position $x$ and time $t$ and $\lambda$ a mortality rate due to environment constraints or predation.

A stochastic modelling of turbulent regime could be added to the velocity field with a stochastic noise term:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + (\field{v} + \sigma(x, t)) \cdot \nabla S = \nabla \cdot (\tensor{D}_s \nabla S) - \lambda S
\end{align}


On another hand, soil moisture distribution is essential for vegetation survival and ecosystem stability. The movement of water through soil is governed by surface runoff, subsurface infiltration, and capillary action, which are affected by slope, soil texture, and plant uptake rates. In hilly or mountainous regions, gravity-driven water flow dominates soil moisture distribution, creating hydrological gradients that shape vegetation structure.

The movement of soil moisture can be approximated by the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation \cite{Ogden2017}, a modified form of the Richards equation:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial W}{\partial t} + \field{v} \cdot \nabla W = \nabla \cdot (D_W \nabla W ) - S
\end{align}
with $W(x, t)$ the water concentration at position $x$ and time $t$, $D_W$ the water diffusion coefficient, $S$ the plant water uptake (the amount of water absorbed or transpired, mainly by the roots of vegetation \cite{Peters2020,Shanin2015}), and $\field{v} = - K g \hat z$ a simplified velocity field provided by the slope hindered by the hydraulic conductivity $K$.

Steeper slopes enhance runoff, reducing soil water retention and increasing drought susceptibility in these regions. Conversely, water accumulates in lowland areas, promoting denser vegetation and the formation of wetlands or riparian ecosystems. As a result, topography directly influences plant distribution, with drought-resistant species dominating slopes and water-demanding species thriving in valleys.

We find in the advection-reaction-diffusion equation a general way to represent a multitude of natural phenomena: from the propagation of bacteria, prey and predators, to the spread of nutrients, of water, or even of fire \cite{Hadrich2021}. 

\midConclusion

In summary, the literature offers a spectrum of discrete and continuous approaches. Our method borrows the field coupling of EFMs, the sparse symbolic efficiency of Environmental Objects, and analytic steady-state solvers from reaction-diffusion theory, combining them into a multi-scale, interactive generator suited for both underwater and terrestrial scenes.









\section{Description of the method}
\label{sec:env-obj_pipeline}

In this section, we present the pipeline that underpins our method. 
We first introduce the continuous environmental fields (\glosses{EnvVal}), then the discrete actors that percieve and affect those fields (\glosses{EnvObj}), before detailing how they modify the fields (\glosses{EnvModif}) and how the full pipeline orchestrates their interaction.

Our approach introduces the concept of \glosses{EnvObj}, simplified, scale-agnostic, terrain features that interact with their surroundings to simulate complex ecosystem dynamics. These \glosses{EnvObj}, which can represent natural features such as trees, rivers, or rocks, influence and are influenced by scalar fields such as temperature, humidity, and elevation. The method is structured into three key phases: initialization, which sets up the foundational terrain elements and \glosses{EnvObj} definitions; an iterative generation process that instantiates \glosses{EnvObj} and lets them interact with their environment; and finally, an output stage that yields a sparse representation of the scene's features. This section details each phase and explains how the system dynamically adapts to user input and environmental changes.

\subsection{\Glosses{EnvVal}}
\label{sec:env-obj_communication}

In geography, and in the Ecological Field Models reviewed earlier, a "field" is a spatially continuous variable defined at every point of the domain.  
It may be a scalar (elevation, temperature) or a vector (wind, current). We follow the geographic usage of "field" as a spatially continuous attribute (scalar or vector). To avoid clashing with algebraic "field" or computer graphics jargon, we call every such quantity an \gloss{EnvVal}.

In an ecosystem simulation, each actor of the ecosystem has an impact on all other actors, which results in an exponentially growing computation effort as the number of elements of the terrain increase. Direct pairwise interaction between $n$ organisms scales as $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$.  
Instead, we adopt the standard EFM strategy: every \gloss{EnvObj} writes to local \glosses{EnvVal} through its \gloss{EnvModif}.  
Each objects then read those values later, turning the global complexity into a linear complexity per simulation step and thus remaining interactive even for thousands of objects.

We bundle the currently supported fields under the unified term "environment", denoted as $\environment = (\height,\; \Water,\; \Wlevel,\; \material)$,  
where $\height$ (height) and $\Wlevel$ (water level) are scalars, $\Water$ (water currents) is a 2D vector field, and $\material$ (\glosses{EnvMat}) is a vector of per-point resource stocks (sand, salt, moisture, limestone, ...). 

These \glosses{EnvMat} are conceptual reservoirs used by rule sets. They need not be visualised nor stored as layered textures.

\subsection{\Glosses{EnvObj}}
\label{sec:env-obj_environmental-objects}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{assets-demo.pdf}

\end{figure}

A geographical feature, also called object or entity, is defined as a discrete phenomenon located at or near the Earth's surface, relevant in geography and geographic information science (GIScience). It represents geographic information that can be depicted in maps, geographic information systems (GIS), and other forms of geographic media. This term includes both natural and human-made objects, ranging from tangible items like buildings or trees to intangible concepts like neighborhoods or savanna. Features are distinct entities with defined boundaries, differentiating them from continuous geographic masses or processes occurring over time. They can be categorized as natural features, such as ecosystems, biomes, water bodies, and landforms, or artificial features, such as settlements, administrative regions, and engineered constructs. As the term "feature" is overused in computer science, we will use the term \gloss{EnvObj} in this work.

\AltTextImage{
Each \gloss{EnvObj} is anchored by a skeleton (a point, curve, or region in the cartographic sense) which captures its footprint while postponing heavy geometry generation (\cref{fig:env-objs_example-scheme1}).  
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{Point-based}: isolated boulders, individual trees, individual corals, ...
    \Item{Curve-based}: river, coral reefs, fault scarps, ...
    \Item{Region-based}: islands, forests, sediment patches, ... 
\end{Itemize}
Via its prescribed \glosses{EnvModif}, an \gloss{EnvObj} locally deposits, removes, or diverts \glosses{EnvMat}, thereby updating the surrounding \glosses{EnvVal}.  Conversely, its viability is re-evaluated through a user-defined \gloss{FitnessFunc} that samples those same fields.  If viable, a \gloss{FittingFunc} refines the skeleton (e.g. a river streams downhill, and seagrass meadow patches are limited to luminous areas).
}{Env-obj-scheme1.png}{Environmental objects, from 2D (top) to their 3D geometry (bottom)}{fig:env-objs_example-scheme1}



\subsection{\Glosses{EnvModif}}

The environment determines if a \gloss{EnvObj} belongs at a certain position. 
When a \gloss{EnvObj} is placed, its surrounding \glosses{EnvVal} can be affected though \glosses{EnvModif} ($\,\environmentModif = (\heightModif, \waterModif, \nothing, \materialModif)\,$) define a change of height~$\heightModif$, modifications of the water current field~$\waterModif$, and \gloss{EnvMat} alterations~$\materialModif$.

\Glosses{EnvObj} are subject to altitude constraints. 
However, to maintain a clear distinction between semantic modeling and 3D modeling, we do not compute the exact physical shape or detailed height field of each \gloss{EnvObj}. 
Instead, we define a \gloss{CoarseHeight}~$\heightModif$, a parametric surface derived from the \gloss{Skeleton}, that provides a coarse estimate of local elevation changes. This coarse proxy lets us evaluate altitude-dependent rules without the cost of globally computing the height field.

Altering the vector field~$\Water$ is performed by composing the individual contributions $\waterModif$ of each object at position~$\p$, following \citep{Wejchert1991}. For efficiency we adopt an analytical deformation kernel inspired by Kelvinlet solutions \cite{DeGoes2017} to aggregate these local disturbances.

Each \gloss{EnvObj} possesses intrinsic \glosses{EnvMat} that both spread and are absorbed around its skeleton over time. For example, a coral colony deposits limestone while simultaneously slowing currents; the reef then uptakes that limestone for growth.  
In our model the colony contributes a deposition term $\materialModif_{\text{limestone}}$, and the reef absorbs it. No direct object-object message passing is required.

Scalar \glosses{EnvVal} are updated by adding or removing mass around the \gloss{Skeleton} and then diffusing it, biased by $\Water$. 
We assume a \gloss{SteadyState} regime, guaranteed by a decay rate~$\decay \in\;]0; 1[$ that prevents unbounded accumulation during advection-diffusion.

\subsection{Pipeline}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics{pipeline.pdf}
    \caption{Overview of the pipeline of the method. The user provides as input an initial height field and sets the water level, as well as a definition of the \glosses{EnvMat} properties and \glosses{EnvObj} properties that will be used in the iterative process. These inputs are initialized as an initial set of \glosses{EnvObj} and scalar fields that represents the \glosses{EnvVal}. In the iterative loop, new \glosses{EnvObj} are instantiated using the current state of the environment at their optimal position. The existing \glosses{EnvObj} in the terrain reevaluate their \gloss{FitnessFunc} to grow or die and update the \glosses{EnvVal} locally. At each iteration, \glosses{GeoEvent} can update the \glosses{EnvVal}, while the user can interact directly with the \glosses{EnvObj}. The result of the whole process is a set of \glosses{EnvObj} which is a sparse representation of the features of the scene. }
    \label{fig:env-obj_pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Initialization}

We initialise the terrain with a height-field $h$ and a water-level $\Wlevel$. During this chapter we will include many \glosses{EnvObj} depending on altitude or depth, so we will use the shorthand notations $\height = h-\Wlevel$ (signed height above water) and $\depth=-\height$ (signed depth below water). The height field provides variation on the altitude, which can influence the generation process of the scene.

A catalogue of available \glosses{EnvObj} $\availableObjects$ is supplied, as well as an optional target list of \glosses{EnvObj} $\targetObjects$ used as a stop condition of the process.

Finally, different \glosses{EnvMat} are defined with properties such as diffusivity, density, decay-rate, and advection sensitivity. These parameters are chosen with field experts to reflect plausible physical behaviour.

An initial environment configuration, resulting from the initial height field $h$ and water level $\Wlevel$, the \glosses{EnvMat} distribution $\material$ (represented as scalar fields $\material: \R^2 \to \R$) and water currents $\Water$ (as a vector field $\Water: \R^2 \to \R^2$), is then available for all \glosses{EnvObj} to evaluate growth and spawning. The \glosses{EnvVal} is noted $\environment = (\height, \Water, \Wlevel, \material)$ (\cref{sec:env-obj_communication}).

The definition of \glosses{EnvObj}' properties and \glosses{EnvVal} is done with field experts, who first decide which \glosses{EnvMat} layers are relevant for the target biome and then anchor the corresponding parameters in the system.
The generation phase starts from this environment plus an optional seed set of \glosses{EnvObj}.


\subsubsection{Generation process}

%- Main loop
After initialization the system enters an incremental loop with two stages: 
\begin{Itemize}
    \Item{-} instantiate candidate \glosses{EnvObj}, then  
    \Item{-} update the environment.  
\end{Itemize}
The loop terminates when user-defined criteria are met (e.g.\ an iteration count threshold, the target set of \glosses{EnvObj} $\targetObjects$, or manual approval).

% -------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsubsection{Instantiation}

Each iteration proposes new \glosses{EnvObj} at locations sampled stochastically and ranked by their \glosses{GenRule} (\cref{sec:env-obj_generation-rules}).  
Every instantiated object immediately evaluates its own viability through the user-supplied \gloss{FitnessFunc} and adjusts shape and pose with the \gloss{FittingFunc}.

% -------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsubsection{Environment update}
After instantiation, every \gloss{EnvObj} applies its \glosses{EnvModif}: perturbing the flow field $\Water$ (\cref{sec:env-obj_water-currents}), and deforming the coarse height field $\height$, then depositing or absorbing \glosses{EnvMat} $\material$ (\cref{sec:env-obj_materials}) as an advection-diffusion solver relaxes \glosses{EnvMat} under current-driven transport and gravity until a local steady state is reached.

At any iteration the user may edit individual \glosses{EnvObj} interactively (\cref{sec:env-obj_manual-interaction}) or schedule \glosses{GeoEvent}, such as storms or ground subsidence, that modify \glosses{EnvVal} globally (\cref{sec:env-obj_events}).

\subsubsection{Output}
% - Output result
The output of our system is a set of \glosses{EnvObj} stored as 2D skeletons in the plane. We deliberately stop at this sparse, symbolic level; meshing, texturing, and final rendering are left to downstream tools chosen by the end-user. For each object, we export its skeleton geometry, semantic class, and environment-modifier parameters, enough to drive terrain synthesis or placement of assets in a game engine or simulator. Figures in this chapter illustrate possible renderings generated with a mix of implicit surfaces and triangular meshes (\cref{fig:env-obj_assets}).



\section{Placement of \glosses{EnvObj} in an environment}
\label{sec:env-obj_generation-rules}
At each iteration of our algorithm, we aim to place new \glosses{EnvObj} at plausible locations. Because we do not enforce physical time continuity, our goal is to progressively enrich the scene according to user intent while maintaining ecological and geological plausibility.
Because each \gloss{EnvObj} modifies the environment when instantiated, potentially destabilizing previous placements, the goal is to insert new elements where they minimally disturb the existing scene.

Our placement algorithm proceeds in two steps: first, it identifies the globally most suitable position using the \gloss{FitnessFunc} $\fitnessFunc: \environment \to \R$, which depends on environmental factors such as altitude $\height(\p)$, water flow $\Water(\p)$, water level $\Wlevel(\p)$, and material availability $\material(\p)$. Second, it refines the object's shape and pose using its \gloss{FittingFunc} $\fittingFunc: \environment \to \R$.

For notational simplicity, we abbreviate $\fitnessFunc(\environment(\p))$ and $\fittingFunc(\environment(\p))$ as $\fitnessFunc(\p)$ and $\fittingFunc(\p)$, respectively.

\subsection{\Gloss{FitnessFunc} }

\begin{figure}
    \autofitgraphics[]{coral-erosion-example.pdf, rock-erosion-example.pdf}
    \caption{While the \gloss{FitnessFunc} guides the position of the \glosses{EnvObj}, the \gloss{FittingFunc} provide an indication of the suitability of the \gloss{EnvObj} in its surroundings. This information is used to determine if the \gloss{EnvObj} should be removed, but may also be used for visual purposes to indicate unhealthy corals or eroded rocks. }
    \label{fig:env-obj_procedural-erosion}
\end{figure}


"Darwinian fitness" refers to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. It is a measure of how well-suited an organism is to its surroundings, and those with higher fitness are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. In a similar vein, the \gloss{FitnessFunc} of a \gloss{EnvObj} evaluates its suitability at a location in the terrain, extending the meaning to living features like forests and corals and non-living elements such as rivers, mountains, karsts, etc.

The fitness function $\fitnessFunc$ quantitatively evaluates how well a given environment location satisfies the requirements of an environment object (\gloss{EnvObj}). In other words, $\fitnessFunc$ returns a numeric score representing the suitability of local environmental conditions for that object. This function considers various environmental variables such as altitude, the presence of specific materials, water current strength, and their respective gradients. Crucially, $\fitnessFunc$ is defined separately for each \gloss{EnvObj} class, allowing it to be tailored to the unique needs and tolerances of different object types. Higher $\fitnessFunc$ values indicate more favorable sites for the object, while lower values correspond to less suitable or inhospitable locations. 


Different types of \glosses{EnvObj} require different criteria for their fitness evaluation. For example, a river might prioritize lower altitude and proximity to water currents, while a forest might prioritize higher altitude and specific material availability. The flexibility of the fitness function allows it to be customized for each \gloss{EnvObj}, ensuring that the generated terrain remains coherent and realistic.

% For example, a mining facility \gloss{EnvObj} might achieve a high fitness only in locations where the targeted mineral is abundant in the ground (reflecting a material presence requirement). If that resource is absent, the mining facility's $\fitnessFunc$ value at that site would be near zero regardless of other conditions. By contrast, a heavy building structure prefers flat, stable terrain. Its fitness function peaks on low-gradient ground underlain by solid bedrock, and it drops off on steep slopes or soft soil where stability is poor. Similarly, an aquatic organism (or installation) thrives within a specific range of water flow: its $\fitnessFunc$ is maximized at an optimal current speed and declines in either stagnant waters or excessively strong currents. These examples illustrate how different environment variables contribute to $\fitnessFunc$ in distinct ways depending on the object class, with each fitness function capturing the particular environmental needs of that object type. 

In practice, to find suitable locations for an object, we evaluate its $\fitnessFunc$ across the environment's spatial domain. This typically involves sampling $\fitnessFunc$ values on a grid or at numerous candidate points covering the area of interest, effectively producing a fitness map for that object class. If an object occupies an area (rather than being point-like), the fitness of a proposed placement can be obtained by aggregating $\fitnessFunc$ over that area by averaging the fitness values at multiple sample points within the object's footprint. The outcome is a field of fitness values where peaks indicate highly suitable locations. Each object class thus yields its own fitness landscape. These fitness landscapes serve as a crucial input to the placement algorithm: the subsequent \gloss{FittingFunc} uses them to guide and optimize the configuration of objects in the environment.

The value of the \gloss{FitnessFunc} can be used later on to modify the geometric representation or the aspect of the \gloss{EnvObj} to appear more eroded (\cref{fig:env-obj_procedural-erosion}).









\subsection{\Gloss{FittingFunc}}

A candidate object is first seeded at the point $\p_s=\arg\!\max_\p \fitnessFunc(\p)$, i.e.\ the global maximum of the fitness map.  This seed acts as the initial guess for the subsequent shape optimisation described below. Moreover, this two-steps optimisation allows a coarse approximation of the global maximum of the \gloss{FitnessFunc} with few samples, reducing its computational demand, as the \gloss{FittingFunc} optimization is focused on a single seed.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Point-based \gloss{Skeleton}}
For objects whose skeleton reduces to a single point (boulders, solitary corals, etc.) we refine the seed by hill-climbing on a (possibly different) fitting field $\fittingFunc$. In most cases we simply set $\fittingFunc=\fitnessFunc$, but the user may supply a sharper or multi-objective field when needed. Optimisation proceeds by gradient ascent on $\nabla\fittingFunc$ with a small step size and terminates when $\|\nabla \fittingFunc\|<\varepsilon$.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Curve-based \gloss{Skeleton}}
The skeleton of a curve-based \gloss{EnvObj} is determined by the shape that fits the most given the environment it is added to. 
Using an Active-Contour ("snake") formulation \cite{Kass1988}, we seek a parametric curve $\curve(s)\!:\![0,1]\!\to\!\R^{2}$ that minimises the composite energy  
\begin{align}
    \energy(\curve) = \Einternal + \Eexternal + \Eshape + \Egradient
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:env-obj_snake-energy-equation-internal}
    \Einternal &= \Ainternal \left( \int_{\curve}{ \norm{\curve'(s)}^2 \, ds} + \int_{\curve}{ \norm{\curve''(s)}^2 \, ds}  \right) \\
    \label{eq:env-obj_snake-energy-equation-external}
    \Eexternal &= -\Aexternal \int_{\curve}{ \fittingFunc(\curve(s)) \, ds } \\
    \label{eq:env-obj_snake-energy-equation-shape}
    \Eshape    &= \Ashape \left( \Length - \int_{\curve}{ \, ds } \right)^2 \\
    \label{eq:env-obj_snake-energy-equation-gradient}
    % \Egradient &= \Agradient \int_{\curve}{ \dot{\curve'(s)}{\Delta \fittingFunc(\curve(s))} \, ds }
    \Egradient &= \Agradient \int_{\curve}{\bigl\langle \curve'(s),\nabla\fittingFunc\left(\curve(s)\right)\bigr\rangle ds}
\end{align}
Here $\alpha_{\bullet}$ are user-tunable weights and $\Length$ is an optional target length. The minus sign in $\Eexternal$ converts the integrand into an attraction term (high $\fittingFunc$ lowers the energy).

In this configuration, $\Einternal$ induce a smooth continuity of the curve by reducing the spacing of each point while reducing the curvature. Another energy, $\Eexternal$ integrate the \gloss{FittingFunc} over the curve, often seen as an attractor of the points, that tries to descent the gradient to find local minima. At the same time, $\Eshape$ apply constraints on the curve shape, which, in this case, is to target a specific length $\Length$. As such, the curve search for an optimized shape given constraints in $\Eshape$ for minimizing $\Eexternal$. We introduced a new term $\Egradient$ in the energy computation that push the points of the curve in the direction of the slope of the \gloss{FittingFunc}, also providing an orientation for the curve.

If a steep coast can be found where the terrain slope is important near the water level, we can define $\fittingFunc = \abs{\height + 1} / \norm{\Delta \height}$, but no orientation is needed, thus we set $\Agradient = 0$. In this case, the curve will follow a path at the water level and spread its extremities over areas with a steep slope. A river may also be symbolized as a parametric curve, but we need to add information about the direction and magnitude of the slope.  As such, we can use $\fittingFunc = \height$ which forces the direction of the curve to fit with the terrain slope. The introduction of the gradient component provides also an orientation to shapes.


\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Internal energy}
    \begin{align}
        \Einternal &= \Ainternal \left( \int_{\curve}{ \norm{\curve'(s)}^2 \, ds} + \int_{\curve}{ \norm{\curve''(s)}^2 \, ds}  \right) \nonumber
    \end{align}
    The internal energy, already introduced in \citep{Kass1988} is composed of two components imposing penalities on the local properties of the points of the curve. The first derivative forces the points along the curve to be evenly spaced by minimizing the curve tension, while the second derivative restrict it from forming sharp corners. As our aim is to represent natural elements, we rarely find sharp elements and thus, keep the original definition from the Snake formulation.

    In \cref{fig:env-obj_snake-internal} we see the two different components of this energy minimisation: averaging the vector formed by the previous segment with the vector formed by the next segment, we can move the vertex to a position for which the two new segments equal in length. On the other hand, translating the vertex toward its projection minimizes the curvature at this vertex.
}{snake_algorithm_internal.png}{Internal energy minimization for one vertex is done by reducing the difference of length with the next and with the previous vertices, while reducing the curvature at this point. }{fig:env-obj_snake-internal}

\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{External energy}
    \begin{align}
        \Eexternal &= -\Aexternal \int_{\curve}{ \fittingFunc(\curve(s)) \, ds } \nonumber
    \end{align}
    The external energy is also present in the original work. Using an external scalar field, each point of the curve is forced to follow the steepest slope of the field. The external field can be seen as an attractor for the curve (\cref{fig:env-obj_snake-external}).

    The energy is minimized when the vertex is positionned at the global maximum of the scalar field.
}{snake_algorithm_external.png}{The central vertex can optimize its external energy by translating in the same direction as the function gradient $\nabla \fitnessFunc$.}{fig:env-obj_snake-external}

\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Shape energy}
    \begin{align}
        \Eshape    &= \Ashape \left( \Length - \int_{\curve}{ \, ds } \right)^2 \nonumber
    \end{align}
    We introduced the shape energy, an energy defined on the whole curve to apply constraints on its final shape. As many natural features have a given dimension, we may add a constraint on the length of the \gloss{Skeleton} (\cref{fig:env-obj_snake-shape}). 

    The original Snake algorithm is biased, forcing the curve to shrink as the internal forces attracts the vertices towards their neighbors. The introduction of a target length cancels this effect.
}{snake_algorithm_shape.png}{The shape energy is minimized when the arc length of the curve $\curve$ is equal to a parameter $\Length$, obtainable by towards or in opposition of its neighbors. }{fig:env-obj_snake-shape}

\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Gradient energy}
    \begin{align}
        \Egradient &= \Agradient \int_{\curve}{\bigl\langle \curve'(s),\nabla\fittingFunc\left(\curve(s)\right)\bigr\rangle ds} \nonumber
    \end{align}
    In our application, having information about the orientation of \glosses{EnvObj} may be essential. For this purpose, we introduced a gradient energy component in the formulation. The equation impose that the direction of the curve at any point should be directed towards the gradient of the scalar field (\cref{fig:env-obj_snake-gradient}). As the external energy pushes points toward the lowest point of the scalar field, the gradient field restrict the gradient descent for the global curve into a specific way, which may feel more natural.
    
    During the optimization process, the gradient of the scalar field is already evaluated by the external energy optimization, so the addition of the gradient component is almost free.

}{snake_algorithm_gradient.png}{The gradient energy is minimize when the curve cross perpendicularly the gradient function. Black: the initial curve, Blue: a possible curve crossing the gradient. The scalar field is stylized to display isolines that the optimal curve has to cross.}{fig:env-obj_snake-gradient}






%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Region-based \gloss{Skeleton}}

When the skeleton is a closed boundary (island, forest patch, lagoon) we adapt Chan-Vese segmentation \cite{Chan2001}: the gradient term vanishes and the external energy integrates over the enclosed domain.

The resulting energy $\energy$ to minimize for a closed region whose borders are defined by the curve $\curve$ can then be expressed as $\energy(\curve) = \Einternal + \Eexternal + \Eshape$.

The internal energy is expressed identically as for curve-based \glosses{EnvObj}. The extenal energy however, has to be modified to take into account the interior of the region instead of only the borders. We will use the idea of the Chan-Vese algorithm, differentiating the energy value for the inside $\domain$ and the borders $\curve$ of the region \cite{Chan2001, Getreuer2012}.
\begin{align}
    \Eexternal = \lambda_1 \int_{\domain}{ \fittingFunc(s) \, ds } + \lambda_2 \int_{\curve}{ \fittingFunc(\curve(s)) \, ds }
\end{align}

$\lambda_1$ emphasises interior homogeneity (e.g.\ constant humidity for a forest), while $\lambda_2$ attracts the boundary to strong gradients (reef rim at the lagoon edge).%  Parameter tuning follows \cite{Getreuer2012}.

Finally, the shape constraint energy $\Eshape$ can target an area $\Area$, for example.
\begin{align}
    \Eshape = \left( \Area - \int_{\domain}{ \, ds } \right)^2
\end{align}

In our implementation, each \gloss{EnvObj}'s \gloss{Skeleton} is a connected component as we define the boundaries by the connected curve $\curve$, but can be convex or concave. An infinite penality is added for the curve self-intersection.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
At every global iteration each object re-evaluates $\fitnessFunc$.  If $\fitnessFunc(\,\curve\,)<T_{\mathrm{fit}}$ the object is removed; otherwise we can take advantage of the rafinable nature of the Snake algorithm and improve the shape of the \gloss{Skeleton} by minimizing again their \gloss{FittingFunc} multiple global iterations after their instantiation. As the number of \glosses{EnvObj} become important in the scene, reajusting all \glosses{Skeleton} becomes time consuming, so we may use this process for the most recent \glosses{EnvObj} in the scene.

% \subsubsection{Region-based \gloss{Skeleton}}

% Region-based \glosses{EnvObj} follows the same process than curve-based \glosses{EnvObj} to define their \gloss{Skeleton}, at the exception of the gradient energy $\Egradient$ which have null value on closed shapes. 

% The resulting energy $\energy$ to minimize for a closed region whose borders are defined by the curve $\curve$ can then be expressed as $\energy(\curve) = \Einternal + \Eexternal + \Eshape$.

% The internal energy is expressed identically as for curve-based \glosses{EnvObj}. The extenal energy however, has to be modified to take into account the interior of the region instead of only the borders. We will use the idea of the Chan-Vese algorithm, differentiating the energy value for the inside $\domain$ and the borders $\curve$ of the region \cite{Chan2001, Getreuer2012}.

% By adding a factor for the inside $\lambda_1$ and a factor for the borders $\lambda_2$, we can add weight depending on the required optimization. We can then define the external energy component $\Eexternal$ as:
% \begin{align}
%     \Eexternal = \lambda_1 \int_{\domain}{ \fittingFunc(s) \, ds } + \lambda_2 \int_{\curve}{ \fittingFunc(\curve(s)) \, ds }
% \end{align}
% We see that the definition of the energy formulation of the curve-based \glosses{EnvObj} is a specialization of the region-based, with $\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\lambda_2 = \Aexternal$

% The use of external forces on the \gloss{Skeleton} can be useful as some landscape features are easier to define by what they contain, while other by what they separate. For example, a lagoon is formed by coral reefs surrounding it, while a forest is formed by the climatic conditions inside it that are propice for trees. A lagoon may then be defined with $\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\fittingFunc_{\text{lagoon}} = -\material_{\text{coral limestone}}$ while a forest sets $\lambda_2 = 0$ and $\fittingFunc_{\text{forest}} = -\material_{\text{humidity}} + \material_{\text{shade}} + \abs{\material_{temperature} - 10}^2$.

% Finally, the shape constraint energy $\Eshape$ can target an area $\Area$, for example.
% \begin{align}
%     \Eshape = \left( \Area - \int_{\domain}{ \, ds } \right)^2
% \end{align}

% In our implementation, each \gloss{EnvObj}'s \gloss{Skeleton} is a connected component as we define the boundaries by the connected curve $\curve$, but can be convex or concave. An infinite penality is added for the curve self-intersection.

% At each iteration, \glosses{EnvObj} are interrogated to verify if they are still fitted to belong at their position. We first check that the fitness is above a given threshold  $\fitnessFunc > T_{\fitnessFunc}$. If not, we remove the \gloss{EnvObj} from the scene. On the other case, we can improve the shape of the \gloss{Skeleton} by minimizing again their \gloss{FittingFunc}. As the number of \glosses{EnvObj} become important in the scene, the reajustment time for the \glosses{Skeleton} becomes important. For \glosses{EnvObj} that have been present for multiple iterations, we consider less iterations and an increased convergence threshold up to a point where the features are static.

% ---------- Environment modifiers -------------------------------------------
\section{\Glosses{EnvModif}}
\label{sec:env-obj_materials}

Every instantiated \gloss{EnvObj} contributes a local \gloss{EnvModif} tuple $\environmentModif_o=(\heightModif_o,\;\waterModif_o,\;\materialModif_o)$, affecting elevation, flow, and resource fields, respectively. At the end of each iteration we assemble the provisional environment
\begin{align}
  \environment^{\star} = \environment + {\sum_{o\in\objects}}\environmentModif_o,
\end{align}
before advection-diffusion relaxation and viability tests.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\Gloss{EnvMat} modifiers}
For every material layer $m \in \material$ (sand, limestone, nutrients, ...), we store a scalar availability field $\material_m(\p,t)$ defined on the plane. This is not a volumetric thickness, merely a stock or probability used by the placement rules (Sec.~\ref{sec:env-obj_communication}).

Each material has four transport parameters $(\mass,\,\velFactor,\,\diffusion,\,\decay)$: mass density $\mass$, flow-coupling factor $\velFactor$, molecular diffusivity $\diffusion$, and first-order decay rate $\decay$.


A living or abiotic object can deposit (positive source) or absorb (negative source) material, thereby mediating indirect interaction with its neighbours.  For object $o$ we denote the net source term $S_{m,o}(\p)$:
\begin{align}
    S_{m,o}(\p) = \left(\deposition_{m,o} - \absorption_{m,o}\right) G(d(\p,\curve_o)),
\end{align}
where $G$ is a Gaussian kernel centred on the skeleton and $d(\cdot)$ is the distance from the skeleton.


Material advection combines gravity-driven downslope drift and water-borne transport.  We approximate the velocity field
\begin{align}
    \warp(\p, t) = \mass \nabla \height(\p, t) + \velFactor \Water(\p, t)
\end{align}

The \glosses{EnvMat} are also dispersed at a diffusion rate $\diffusion$, for which we can use the advection-diffusion-reaction equation to evaluate the distribution over time $t$
\begin{align} 
	\label{eq:material-displacement-equation}
    \frac{\partial \material}{\partial t} \warp \nabla \material = \diffusion \nabla^2 \material - \decay \material
\end{align}

We solve \eqref{eq:material-displacement-equation} numerically using Euler integration
\begin{align}
    \material(\p, t + dt) &= \material(\p, t) + dt ( \diffusion \nabla^2 \material(\p, t) - \decay \material(\p, t) \\ & - \warp(\p, t) \nabla \material(\p, t) ) \nonumber
\end{align}

The linear decay $\decay$ avoids indefinite mass build-up and ensures a steady state when sources balance sinks (\cref{fig:env-obj_stability-examples}), following the practice of ecological field models \cite{Seidl2012}.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Height modifiers}
Terrain elevation is updated by blending the \gloss{CoarseHeight} functions of all objects that overlap a query point $\p$. We can then simplify the shape of \glosses{EnvObj} to analytical functions such of a mountain to a cone, a reef as a curved cylinder or a coral boulder as a sphere, enabling fast, on-demand, and multi-scale computation of the altitude at any point. Because we work with a DEM, overhangs are ignored.

To preserve ordering constraints we partition objects into three mutually exclusive groups:
\begin{Itemize}
  \Item{$\groundedHeight$} grounded data (e.g.\ islands) defined from the absolute zero level,
  \Item{$\altitudeHeight$} altitude-relative shapes (depth-constrained corals, tidal flats),
  \Item{$\surfaceHeight$} fine surface details that sit on the current terrain, that can be seen as bumps or carves from an aerial view. 
\end{Itemize}

\AltTextImage{
    Groups $\groundedHeight$ and $\altitudeHeight$ are combined with our smooth maximum/minimum operators as presented in the previous chapter to avoid $\curve^{0}$
    discontinuities, while surface details in $\surfaceHeight$ are simply summed:
    \begin{align}
    \heightModif_{\groundedHeight}(\p) &=
        \smoothmax_{o\in\groundedHeight}\heightModif_o(\p),\\
    \heightModif_{\altitudeHeight}(\p) &=
        \smoothmin_{o\in\altitudeHeight}\heightModif_o(\p),\\
    \heightModif_{\surfaceHeight}(\p) &=
        \sum_{o\in\surfaceHeight}\heightModif_o(\p).
    \end{align}

    The final coarse elevation and its analytic gradient (for slope queries) are then
    \begin{align}
        \height^{\star}(\p)=
        \smoothmax \left(\heightModif_{\groundedHeight},\;\heightModif_{\altitudeHeight}\right) + \heightModif_{\surfaceHeight}.
    \end{align}
    The gradient $\nabla\height^{\star}$ is used by fitness rules that depend
    on slope, as well as the analytic water flow simulation $\Wsimu$.
}{height_modif.png}{The final \gloss{CoarseHeight} is a combination of the three groups of \glosses{EnvObj}: grounded data $\groundedHeight$ (red) and altitude-relative shapes $\altitudeHeight$ (orange) are aggregated by the $\smoothmax$ operator, then the surface elements $\surfaceHeight$ (green) are added. }{fig:env-obj_height-modif}












% \section{\Glosses{EnvModif}}
% \label{sec:env-obj_materials}
% Each \gloss{EnvObj} once present in the scene has an impact on the environment $\environment$ through their modifiers $\environmentModif$. We list three types of influence, which are the \gloss{EnvMat} modifiers $\materialModif$, the height modifiers $\heightModif$ and the water modifiers $\waterModif$. These modifiers are direct impact and can be computed as 
% \begin{align*}
%     \environment^* = \environment + \sum_{o \in \objects}{ \environmentModif_o }
% \end{align*}

% \subsection{\Gloss{EnvMat} modifiers}
% The environment is composed of a scalar field for each of the possible material that can be found in the terrain. The scalar fields represents the availability of the material at any point, but not a height field. Each material is defined with a mass $\mass$, a fluid velocity factor $\velFactor$, a diffusion rate $\diffusion$ and finally a decay rate $\decay$.

% Each \gloss{EnvObj} in the terrain is a source and a sink of \glosses{EnvMat}. It is the main mean of communication between \glosses{EnvObj} as it allows them to interact with their surrounding environment. We define the amount of deposed material with $\deposition_\material$ and $\absorption_\material$ the amount of material deposed and absorbed by the \gloss{EnvObj} and $\growthRate(t) \in [0, 1]$ a factor related with the current state of the \gloss{EnvObj}, which state that more material will be displaced when the \gloss{EnvObj} is fully formed than when it was just spawn:
% \begin{align*}
%     \int_{0}^{t} {\growthRate(t) \left( \deposition_\material - \absorption_\material \right) \,dt}
% \end{align*} 
% The deposition and absorption around an \gloss{EnvObj} is defined using the Gaussian kernel distance computation from the skeleton.

% The scalar field for the material $\material$ is displaced by using a warp operator $\warp$, taking into account the water flow $\Water$ and the terrain slope $\nabla \height$. We unified the warp with $\mass$ the mass of the material and $\velFactor$ a influence factor of the fluid on the material: 
% \begin{align*}
%     \warp(\p, t) = \mass \nabla \height(\p, t) + \velFactor \Water(\p, t)
% \end{align*}
 
% % \Glosses{EnvMat} are not seen as particles but more as a probabilistic distribution, so we allowed us to simplify the transport rate equations in this simpler version.
% The \glosses{EnvMat} are also dispersed at a diffusion rate $\diffusion$, for which we can use the advection-diffusion-reaction equation to evaluate the distribution after a time $t$
% \begin{align} 
% 	\label{eq:material-displacement-equation}
%     \frac{\partial \material}{\partial t} \warp \nabla \material = \diffusion \nabla^2 \material - \decay \material
% \end{align}

% We solve \eqref{eq:material-displacement-equation} numerically using Euler integration
% \begin{align}
%     \material(\p, t + dt) &= \material(\p, t) + dt ( \diffusion \nabla^2 \material(\p, t) - \decay \material(\p, t) \\ & - \warp(\p, t) \nabla \material(\p, t) ) \nonumber
% \end{align}

% The introduction of the decay rate $\decay \in ]0; 1]$ in the equation allows for the reach of a steady-state, where we can consider the simulation stable. As the user updates the state of the simulation manually, we observe the reach of this steady state before continuing the iterative steps (\cref{fig:env-obj_stability-examples}).

% \subsection{Height modifiers}
% The computation of the height $\height(\p)$ is done using the \gloss{CoarseHeight} of each \gloss{EnvObj} affecting a point $\p$. We can then simplify the shape of a mountain to a cone, a reef as a curved cylinder or a coral boulder as a sphere. As we consider surface height and not surface volume, we use the top-view height field projection, which ignore overhangs and cavities.

% The \gloss{CoarseHeight} is an implicit height field that is used for estimating the shape of the \gloss{EnvObj} while providing a hint of the surface normal at each point. Using implicit surfaces allows us to evaluate the altitude and the slope at any point analytically, without requiring the computation of the whole field. The analytical solution induce the multi-scale aspect of the method. 

% We divide the \glosses{CoarseHeight} in three categories: 
% \begin{Itemize}
%     \Item{} $\mathcal{G}$: \glosses{EnvObj} whose shape is defined from an absolute zero of the terrain,
%     \Item{} $\mathcal{A}$: \glosses{EnvObj} whose shape is defined using a notion of altitude, typical of coral-related elements as the depth from the water surface is prevalent,
%     \Item{} $\mathcal{F}$: \glosses{EnvObj} that are defined at the terrain surface. They represent objects that can be seen as bumps or carves from an aerial view. 
% \end{Itemize}

% % The implicit surface formulation defines a binary tree whose leaves are primitives and nodes are operators \cite{Wyvill1999,Bernhardt2010}. In our implementation, we use the associative property of addition, minimum and maximum binary functions to flatten the trees and bypass the binary restriction that deepen the tree. 

% We compute the depth change given for each category:
% \begin{align*}
%     \heightModif_{\mathcal{G}} (\p) = \smoothmax_{o \in \mathcal{G}}{ \heightModif_o(\p) } \\
%     \heightModif_{\mathcal{A}} (\p) = \smoothmin_{o \in \mathcal{A}}{ \heightModif_o(\p) } \\
%     \heightModif_{\mathcal{F}} (\p) = \sum_{o \in \mathcal{F}}{ \heightModif_o(\p) }
% \end{align*}

% The final altitude is computed as
% \begin{align}
%     \heightModif = \max(\heightModif_{\mathcal{G}}, \heightModif_{\mathcal{A}}) + \heightModif_{\mathcal{F}}
% \end{align}

\subsection{Influence on water currents}
\label{sec:env-obj_water-currents}

We define the global water current as a vector field composed of three components:
\begin{align}
    \Water(\p) = \Wuser(\p) + \Wsimu(\p) + \Wobj(\p)
\end{align}

Here, $\Wuser(\p)$ is a user-defined vector field that provides direct control over the flow direction and intensity using stroke paths, as presented in the previous chapter. The term $\Wsimu(\p)$ is an analytically defined component inspired by the terrain-aware wind simulation approach introduced in \citep{Paris2019b} that we can use for large water bodies fluid simulation. Finally, $\Wobj(\p)$ represents the deformation introduced by environment objects.

The simulated component $\Wsimu$ captures how water flow is diverted and shaped by the underlying terrain. It starts from a uniform flow direction $a$ and introduces warping based on the terrain gradient evaluated at multiple spatial scales. The resulting vector field is expressed as:

\begin{align}
    \Wsimu(\p) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{c_i \warp_i \cdot v}
\end{align}

In this formulation, $v$ is a base velocity vector adjusted according to the terrain elevation:

\begin{align}
    v = a \left(1 + k_w \abs{\height(\p)} \right)
\end{align}
where $a$ is the global flow direction and velocity, $\abs{\height(\p)}$ is the vertical distance from the terrain to the water level at point $\p$, and $k_w$ is a scaling factor simulating the Venturi effect, which increases velocity in regions of compression.

Each $\warp_i \cdot v$ term represents the warping of $v$ at scale $i$, defined as:
\begin{align}
    \warp_i \cdot v = (1 - \alpha) v + \alpha k_i \nabla \Tilde{\height_i}^{\perp}(\p) \quad \text{with} \quad \alpha = \norm{ \nabla \Tilde{\height_i}(\p) }
\end{align}
Here, $\Tilde{\height_i}$ denotes the smoothed terrain elevation at scale $i$, and $\nabla \Tilde{\height_i}^{\perp}(\p)$ is the vector orthogonal to the terrain gradient, directing flow along paths that curve around elevation changes. The blending coefficient $\alpha$ controls the interpolation between the original flow and the deviated flow, based on the steepness of the terrain. The deviation coefficient $k_i$ determines the strength of the flow deflection at each scale.

In accordance with the original method, we employ two spatial scales ($n = 2$), using Gaussian smoothing kernels with radii of 200~m and 50~m. The associated weights are set to $c_0 = 0.8$ and $c_1 = 0.2$, with deviation coefficients $k_0 = 30$ and $k_1 = 5$, respectively. This multi-scale formulation enables the simulation to account for both large topographic features and finer terrain details, resulting in a more nuanced and plausible flow field.

The terrain-based simulation component $\Wsimu$ is designed to model large-scale water current behavior by leveraging an analytical approximation of flow deviation due to terrain. This solver is inspired by the work of \cite{Paris2019b}, originally developed for wind field simulation, and has been adapted here to capture how elevation changes influence the direction and intensity of surface water flow.


The proposed formulation offers a terrain-aware approach to modeling water currents, recognizing that topography is the dominant influence on flow direction in natural environments, particularly in the absence of dynamic fluid interactions. By analyzing terrain gradients at multiple spatial scales, the solver captures both broad elevation patterns and fine landform features, resulting in a plausible, nuanced flow field that naturally conforms to hills, valleys, and river paths without requiring a full physical simulation. Unlike black-box physics-based solvers (discussed further in \cref{chap:erosion}), the analytical formulation of $\Wsimu$ exposes intuitive parameters such as flow direction, elevation sensitivity, and gradient deviation, that can be directly adjusted by the user, making it especially suitable for terrain generation pipelines where user intent or artistic direction must be encoded. The solver is also computationally efficient and supports on-demand evaluation, avoiding the need for dense precomputed data and aligning well with the requirements of real-time systems, streaming terrains, and interactive editors. While the model assumes steady-state flow and does not simulate dynamic phenomena like rainfall, flooding, or erosion, these effects can be layered atop the static flow if needed, preserving a lightweight design that still conveys physically plausible behavior. Finally, our system is purposefully modular: $\Wsimu$ addresses large-scale flow patterns, while small-scale variations such as turbulence, vortices, or flow deviations caused by discrete features, are handled separately by the $\Wobj$ term, allowing each component to specialize in its relevant spatial scale.

% One of the principal motivations for this formulation is its ability to incorporate terrain-awareness directly into the water current model. In natural environments, the underlying topography is the dominant factor determining flow direction, especially in the absence of dynamic fluid interactions. By analyzing the terrain gradient at multiple spatial scales, the solver accounts for both broad elevation patterns and finer landform features. This leads to a more nuanced and plausible flow field that conforms to hills, valleys, and river paths without requiring a full physical simulation.

% This approach offers significant advantages in terms of controllability and procedural integration. Unlike black-box physics-based solvers (presented more deeply in \cref{chap:erosion}), the analytical formulation of $\Wsimu$ exposes intuitive parameters such as flow direction, elevation sensitivity, and gradient deviation that can be tuned directly by designers or procedural rules. This makes the method especially suited for terrain generation pipelines where user intent or artistic direction needs to be encoded into the environment.

% Furthermore, the solver is computationally efficient and supports on-demand evaluation, allowing the vector field to be queried at any position without precomputing or storing dense data structures. This is particularly beneficial for large or streaming terrains, and aligns with the demands of real-time systems, interactive editors, and games.

% The model assumes steady-state flow, focusing on static representations of water movement that are sufficient for many applications in procedural worldbuilding. Dynamic effects such as rainfall response, flooding, or erosion are beyond the scope of this solver but can be layered on top of the static flow if needed. This simplification allows the system to remain lightweight while still conveying a physically plausible behavior of water across terrain.

% Finally, the solver is intentionally designed to handle only the large-scale structure of the flow. Small-scale variations, such as localized turbulence, vortices, or flow redirection around discrete features, are handled separately by the $\Wobj$ term. This separation of concerns allows the model to remain modular and efficient, with each component addressing flow phenomena at its relevant scale.

    $\Wobj$ is a deformation field defined as the accumulation of flow primitives. The use of analytical primitives to represent localized variations within large-scale scenes has been explored in various contexts such as the edition of wind fields (\cite{Wejchert1991}, \cref{fig:env-obj_wejchert-flow}) and authoring of rivers' water surface geometry (\cite{Peytavie2019}, \cref{fig:env-obj_peytavie-river-primitives}). In the latter, flow primitives are primarily used to generate the geometry of the water surface, but the same primitives can also be reused to produce a flow field, enabling effects such as floating debris or leaves drifting along the surface. Because geometry is sensitive to overlapping influences, the authors. organize primitives into a blending tree, where merge and replace operations control how individual contributions interact.

    On the other hand, \cite{Wejchert1991} showed that simply summing flow primitives generates velocity fields that approximate Navier-Stokes dynamics (\cref{fig:}). Because their method affects motion rather than visible geometry, this additive approach offers a good trade-off between plausibility, user control and computation time.

    In our method, we adopt a similar additive approach to combine Kelvinlet-based primitives. Our goal is to define a deformation field and as such, summation offers an effective and intuitive way to accumulate the influence of multiple localized deformations at various scales, without requiring additional structure to resolve overlaps.

% To model the localized influence of environment objects on water currents, we adopt Kelvinlets, a family of closed-form, continuous deformation functions derived from the fundamental solutions to the equations of linear elasticity in an infinite medium.

% \end{figure}

Kelvinlets were introduced to computer graphics as an efficient means of producing physically plausible and interactive deformations \cite{DeGoes2017}. In our context, they provide a smooth and compact representation of flow alterations, ideal for integrating environmental features into vector field modeling.

Kelvinlets are based on the Kelvin solution, which is the Green's function of the Navier-Cauchy equations of linear elasticity. It describes the displacement $\tensor{u}(\p)$ at a point $\p \in \R^3$ caused by a force applied at $\q$, in an isotropic, homogeneous elastic material:
\begin{align}
    \mu \nabla^2 \tensor{u} + (\lambda + \mu) \nabla(\nabla \cdot \tensor{u}) + \delta(\p - \q) \force = 0
\end{align}
where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Lamé parameters, with $\mu$ also known as the shear modulus, and $\force$ is the force vector applied at a single point $\q$ via the Dirac delta function $\delta(\p - \q)$.

\AltTextImage{
    To regularize the singularity at $\p = \q$, \cite{DeGoes2017} introduced a smoothed form known as the regularized Kelvinlets, which allow deformation effects to fall off smoothly with distance, and prevent numerical instabilities.

    Given a center $\q$, an evaluation point $\p$, and a regularization $\eps$, we define $\tensor{r} = \p - \q$ and the regularized distand $r_{\eps} = \sqrt{\|\tensor{r}\|^2 + \eps^2}$.

    We use the scale and grab formulations of the regularized Kelvinlets brushes (\cref{fig:env-obj_kelvinlets-demo}), denoted as $s_\eps(\tensor{r})$ and $g_\eps(\tensor{r})$ respectively to simulate obstruction and diversion, are defined as
    \begin{align*}
        s_\eps(\tensor{r}) &= (2b - a) \left( \frac{1}{r_\eps^3} + \frac{1}{2r_\eps^5} \right)(s \tensor{r}) \\
        g_\eps(\tensor{r}) &= \left[ \frac{a - b}{r_\eps} \identity + \frac{b}{r_\eps^3} \tensor{r} \tensor{r}^t + 
    \frac{a \eps^2}{2 r_\eps^3} \identity \right] \force
    \end{align*}
    with $a = \frac{1}{4 \pi \mu}$ and $b = \frac{a}{4 (1 - \upsilon)}$ provided $\mu$ a shear modulus and $\upsilon$ a Poisson ratio provided for each Kelvinlet, $s$ a scaling factor and $\force$ the force vector of the grab operation. These values are tunable per object to simulate different material or flow resistance behaviors.
}{kelvinlets-grab-demo-DeGoes2017.png, kelvinlets-demo-DeGoes2017.png}{\cite{DeGoes2017} presents four types of deformations using Kelvinets, resulting in organic pinch-like interaction with the original field. Top: a grab on a \textcopyright Disney/Pixar character. From left to right: a twist, a scale and a pinch operation. }{fig:env-obj_kelvinlets-demo}

Deformations defined on curves use $\q = \closestCp$ with $\closestCp$ the closest point on the curve from the point $\p$ and $\force = \curve'(\p)$. We can then define $\tensor{u}_o(\p) = s_\eps(\q - \p) + g_\eps(\p - \q)$.
Finally, we can retrieve the velocity field from the objects, with a per-object coefficient $\lambda_o$ for the strength of its flow effects (due to its size, porosity, surface roughness, ...):
\begin{align}
    \Wobj(\p) = \sum_{o \in \objects}^{}{\lambda_o \tensor{u}_o(\p)}
\end{align}

The use of regularized Kelvinlets is well-suited to our model. They offer a compact representation thanks to their closed-form definition, which allows each deformation to be described analytically without the need for precomputed data or large simulation grids. They maintain continuity, ensuring that the resulting vector field is smooth and free of visual or numerical artifacts, which is crucial when blending influences from multiple environment objects. Their behavior is physically plausible, as they are derived from fundamental solutions to elasticity equations, and can convincingly simulate natural flow behaviors such as deflection around obstacles or local flow obstruction. They are also computationally efficient, since their evaluation is lightweight and independent of the size or complexity of the terrain, making them particularly suitable for integration into large-scale procedural generation pipelines and real-time interactive applications.

% \Glosses{EnvObj} and \glosses{EnvMat} are inspired by the ecological concept of biogeocoenosis, which describes the relationship between living organisms (biotic) and their non-living environment (abiotic). These interactions closely mirror the processes observed in natural ecosystems, where biotic and abiotic components continuously influence each other, leading to a balanced and stable environment. Gubanov and Degermendzhy [CITATION] describe biogeocoenosis as almost-closed systems, with many parallels possible with thermodynamics such as the concept of dynamic equilibrium. In a biogeocoenosis, the various processes, such as the spread of nutrients, the growth of vegetation, or the erosion of soil, tend toward a state of balance. 

% Similarly, in our method, the interaction between \glosses{EnvObj} and \glosses{EnvMat} is modeled using a reaction-diffusion-advection framework. This model captures how \glosses{EnvMat} are spread and absorbed within the terrain. Thanks to the decay rate of the \glosses{EnvMat}, the system progresses toward a dynamic equilibrium, where the distribution of \glosses{EnvMat} stabilizes. This stabilization reflects a state of balance where the rates of spreading and absorption and decay are equal, and the \glosses{EnvVal} become coherent across the landscape. For example, a river might spread sediments downstream, which are gradually absorbed by the surrounding terrain, leading to a stable sediment distribution over time. Similarly, moisture emitted by a forest will eventually reach a balance with the surrounding soil and atmosphere, creating a stable, humid environment.

% The only factor that can disrupt this equilibrium is a change in the \glosses{EnvVal}. Changes such as an increase in temperature, a shift in wind patterns, or the introduction of a new \gloss{EnvObj} can alter the balance, leading to a new phase of interaction and stabilization.


\section{User interactions}
\label{sec:env-obj_interaction}
The user can guide the generation process. The use of simple shapes as \glosses{EnvObj} facilitate the edition of the simulation, as we can interactively add, remove or modify \glosses{EnvObj}, or focus the generation process in a restricted area. Interaction with the \glosses{EnvVal} is also provided as \glosses{GeoEvent}, that the user can invoke during the simulation. While the direct interactions on the \glosses{EnvObj} are instantaneous, as a the \glosses{GeoEvent} are active on a given duration.

\subsection{Direct interactions with the \glosses{EnvObj}}
\label{sec:env-obj_manual-interaction}
The interactive nature of our simulation enables the user to modify the state of the terrain by manipulating directly the \glosses{EnvObj} of the scene. We assume the modifications applied between two iterations of the simulation.

Translating an \gloss{EnvObj} is trivial, we simply requires to evaluate the \gloss{FitnessFunc} of the \glosses{EnvObj} at a translated position to verify that the environment is suitable for its survival.

The deformation of \glosses{EnvObj} can be applied on curve and region \glosses{EnvObj} by updating the control points of the skeleton and recomputing the resulting implicit surfaces. The evaluation positions used for region \glosses{EnvObj} are displaced by applying a cage deformation of the 2D shape using the Green coordinates of points in the shape. After the alteration of the region, evaluation points should be keeping a similar distribution than before, avoiding unexpected results during the interaction.
By modifying an \gloss{EnvObj}, the \glosses{EnvVal} may change, which can result in the destruction of the now incompatible environment objects in the scene (\cref{fig:env-obj_user-interaction}).

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:env-obj_user-interaction}
\end{figure}

As long as a non-zero \gloss{FitnessFunc} is defined in the terrain, new \glosses{EnvObj} can be forced by the user at any point of the simulation. 

% \subsection{Guiding the simulation}
Control over the region of the terrain that should be updated can be given by adjusting all \glosses{FitnessFunc} through a scalar field $\influence: \R^2 \to \R $ such that the \gloss{FitnessFunc} $\fitnessFunc(\p)$ of any new \gloss{EnvObj} is evaluated as $\fitnessFunc^*(\p) = \influence{\p} \fitnessFunc(\p)$. This is especially useful in the planning of robotic simulations as we can first generate the overall shape of our terrain and secondly focus the generation process around the areas that may be visited by the robot, avoiding useless simulations and computer power. 
\cref{fig:env-obj_coral-colonization-scene} shows an example of colonization of the coral polyps that we limited manually into an annulus.

% \end{figure}

% - Changing the water currents

Our water current simulation is modeled as a simple vector field. As such, the user is able to interact with it at any moment of the simulation, allowing for the death of sensible \glosses{EnvObj} while it will guide the simulation into a new landscape. By modifying the water currents, the user also modifies the transport rate of \glosses{EnvMat} at this position. The modification of currents is given as a stroke, a parametric curve $\curve$ for which we evaluate $\Delta \Wuser(\p)$ just as for curved environment objects (\cref{sec:env-obj_water-currents}).

\subsection{Indirect interaction with \glosses{EnvObj}}
\label{sec:env-obj_events}
A configuration file can define in advance the different \glosses{GeoEvent} that should be triggered during the simulation. This can be useful to generate landscapes that are close to some existing locations. 
Multiple \glosses{GeoEvent} can be triggered either as sudden or continuous environmental changes. These changes play a huge role in the morphology of landscapes.
We define \glosses{GeoEvent} with a starting point and an ending point, such that at any time of the simulation we can compute the progress of the \gloss{GeoEvent} as $\tEvent \in [0, 1]$.

Water level changes are important \glosses{GeoEvent} that shape the underwater landscapes. As previously submerged \glosses{EnvObj} get elevated above water level, flora and fauna terrain features dry and die. Deprived from the living part of the features, everything is more affected by terrestrial erosion. By updating the value of the depth $\depth$ evaluated in the \glosses{FitnessFunc}, any \gloss{EnvObj} that is sensible to the depth will be impacted automatically, that may be causing death (\cref{fig:env-obj_water-event}). The modification of the water level is defined as 
\begin{align*}
    \depth(\p) = \depth_0(\p) + \sum_{e \in \events} \Delta \depth_e \tEvent
\end{align*}
with $\Delta \depth_e$ the amount of water rising or lowering during an \gloss{GeoEvent}. We assumed a linear evolution of the water level during an \gloss{GeoEvent}. This allows to evaluate the depth at any point in space and in time.

\begin{figure}
    % \centering
    \autofitgraphics[]{InteractionWater1.png, InteractionWater3.png}
    % \includegraphics[width = 0.45 \linewidth]{InteractionWater1.png}
    % \includegraphics[width = 0.45 \linewidth]{InteractionWater3.png}
    \caption{Lowering the water level by a few meters caused most of the coral objects to satisfy $\fitnessFunc \leq 0$, causing their death. Since the water level (blue) decrease slowly, new coral objects spawn progressively at a lower altitude.}
    \label{fig:env-obj_water-event}
\end{figure}

Subsidence and uplift are the main \glosses{GeoEvent} that create or destroy islands in the long term. These \glosses{GeoEvent} are simulated as a simple factor on the height field of the generated terrain (\cref{fig:env-obj_subsidence-event}). Subsidence is not always uniform in the terrain. As such, the user can provide a position $\q$ at which the subsidence is the strongest, the amount of subsidence applied $\Delta \height_e$ and a standard deviation $\std$ for which we can then compute at any point in space and time of the simulation the height of the terrain
\begin{align*}
    \height(\p) = \height_0(\p) \cdot \sum_{e \in \events}{G(\norm{\p - \q})} \Delta \height_e \tEvent 
\end{align*}
with $G(x)$ the Gaussian function
\begin{align*}
    G(x) = \frac{1}{\std \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left(-\frac {x^{2}}{2 \std ^{2}}\right)
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}
    % \centering
    \autofitgraphics[]{InteractionSubsidence1.png, InteractionSubsidence2.png}

    \caption{Simulating subsidence on a part of the terrain (brown area) cause the depth value to change locally, resulting in the death of coral objects that find themselves too deep to survive. Here two subsidence \glosses{GeoEvent} are triggered in parallel. }
    \label{fig:env-obj_subsidence-event}
\end{figure}

Storms are factors of the geomorphology of coral reefs \cite{VilaConcejo2016, Oron2023} and coasts \cite{Dominguez2005, Cowart2010}. Due to the extreme wind and wave velocities coasts are highly eroded in a short time period and the more fragile corals near the water surface are broken, possibly causing breaches in the reefs and spreading polyps in the currents direction. While there are many factors at play to understand the apparition of storms and the hydrodynamics affecting it, we simplified the model of storms to the user as a single epicenter $\q$ with a wind velocity $\windVelocity$ and a standard deviation $\std$ representing the spread around the epicenter (\cref{fig:env-obj_storm-event}). The computation of water currents are then computed as 
\begin{align*}
    \Wuser(\p) = \Wuser^*(\p) + \sum_{e \in \events} {\windVelocity G(\norm{\p - \q})}
\end{align*}
In this case, we did not include the linear factor $\tEvent$ as storms are usually conserving a constant force for the time of the few weeks or months of their occurrence. 

\begin{figure}
    % \centering
    \autofitgraphics[]{interactionStorm1.png, interactionStorm2.png}
    % \includegraphics[width = 0.45 \linewidth]{interactionStorm1.png}
    % \includegraphics[width = 0.45 \linewidth]{interactionStorm2.png}
    \caption{The result of a storm localized on one side of the island (red area) modifies the result of the evaluation of \glosses{EnvObj} around its epicenter for a short period of time. Most of the coral objects died from the \gloss{GeoEvent}, except few \glosses{EnvObj} less sensible to water currents strength. }
    \label{fig:env-obj_storm-event}
\end{figure}

% Just as for the rise and lowering of water level, the heat is modeled as a simple value of the environment. For shallow areas (<100m) we assume a linear relation between depth and temperature, and a constant value for the terrestrial environment. As such, we can model a heat wave by a change of the \glosses{EnvVal}. \Glosses{EnvObj} who are sensible to temperature may die instantly. The modification of the temperature is defined as 
% \begin{align*}
%     \temperature(\p) = T_0(\p) + \sum_{e \in \events} \Delta \temperature_e \tEvent + \curve \depth(\p)
% \end{align*}
with $\Delta \temperature_e$ the change of heat during an \gloss{GeoEvent}, $\temperature_0$ the temperature at the water surface, and $\curve$ a very small factor.

The framework can easily be extended as the \gloss{GeoEvent} system stays similar for all \glosses{GeoEvent}. Including higher level simulations in the \gloss{GeoEvent} system can be added, such as the simulation of tectonic activity, the use of fluid dynamics for tsunami \glosses{GeoEvent}, the integration of human activity, ...

\section{Results and discussion}
\label{sec:env-obj_results}
Our method provides a way to generate scenes at different scales. We demonstrate this capacity with the generation of a large scene of an island (\cref{fig:env-obj_teaser}) after what we focused the generation process in a canyon (\cref{fig:env-obj_canyon-scene}), then a small-scale visualization of coral colonies (\cref{fig:env-obj_coral-colonization-scene}).
In the examples, we rendered the \glosses{EnvObj} as a implicit tree or as individual meshes. The island, lagoons, reefs, canyons and sand ripples as implicit surfaces

% \subsection{Mid-scale}
% \label{sec:env-obj_mid-scale}
A canyon scene can be generated using our method. The water flow is affected by the curve of the canyon such that the currents are oriented in the direction of the curve's tangent.In this example, we force the position of arches to be inside the canyon. The arches deposits a material "rock deposit", which is the main element of the \gloss{FitnessFunc} of the Rock object. The "rock deposit" is slightly affected by water currents, but its mass make it highly affected by gravity. As such, rocks will spawn underneath arches. In reality, an arch is often created as part of a large coral boulder that sees the calcareous bottom part detached by the water currents, often resulting in an arch surrounded by big rocks and smaller rocks from the erosion of the first rocks.
As such, we define an \gloss{EnvObj} "Arch" with a \gloss{FitnessFunc} $\fitnessFunc_{arch}(\p) = 5 - d(canyon - \p) * \norm{\Water(\p)}$, an \gloss{EnvObj} "Rock" using $\fitnessFunc_{rock}(\p) = \material_{rock\_deposit}(\p)$ and Pebble using $\fitnessFunc_{pebble}(\p) = \material_{smaller\_rock\_deposit}(\p)$. Finally, sand ripples are simply described as curves appearing where there is a lot of sand available: $\fitnessFunc_{ripple}(\p) = \material_{sand}(\p)$.
Following these simple rules, \cref{fig:env-obj_canyon-scene} shows the emergence of details in the scene. 

% \subsection{Small-scale}
% \label{sec:env-obj_small-scale}
In this example we defined three different types of corals, coralA, coralB and coralC, to illustrate the possibility to model behaviours from the choice of \glosses{FitnessFunc}. Each of the coral types deposits a material "coral polyp" and "coral polyp A" ("coral polyp B" and "coral polyp \curve" respectively). By considering a \gloss{FitnessFunc} that minimize the ratio $\frac{\text{coral polyp}}{\text{coral polyp A}}$, we can see an emergent behavior of the three types of coral fighting for the space colonization.
\cref{fig:env-obj_coral-colonization-scene} shows the result of this simulation at three different interations. At the border between two colonies, none of the colonies make progression due to the amount of coral polyp specific from the other colony.

The proposed method aims to generate plausible landscapes using simplified versions of the evolution of an ecosystem and of the 3D representation. The biological realism of the result is highly correlated to the amount of simplification and assumptions, while the visual realism is completely dependent to the geometric functions used for the 3D modeling of the \glosses{EnvObj}. While proposing a flexible method that propose a generic approach for terrain generation, a close collaboration with fields experts and with graphists is needed to achieve optimal results.

Most simulation algorithm's quality depends on the size of the time step used, but with the introduction of a decay rate in the \glosses{EnvMat} properties, we limit the influence of time steps by considering that steady-state are reachable. The material deposition and absorption on punctual \glosses{EnvObj} can be seen as a Dirac function $\dirac$ centered at their position resulting in the advantage that material displacement function can use the definition of the diffusion equation instead of the advection-diffusion-reaction equation. This equation allowing us to evaluate the state of the material $\material$ without intermediate steps, but this is not applicable with curve- and region-based \glosses{EnvObj}. 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:env-obj_conclusion}
We have proposed a method to generate terrains procedurally using sparse representations. This representation, the \glosses{EnvObj}, enables to introduce expert knowledge by the mean of the \glosses{FitnessFunc} that rule the \glosses{EnvObj} life cycle, but also to integrate the user in the loop during the generation process. We reduced the terrain resolution limitations by defining the environment objects as parametric features. Thanks to the sparse representation based on single points, curves and regions, we allow for direct manipulation of the \glosses{EnvObj} of the scene by the user which, thanks to the environment steady state consideration, also enables to include these interactions in the automatic simulation process.
Integrating environmental properties in the \gloss{FitnessFunc} of \glosses{EnvObj} allows the user to guide the generation through \glosses{GeoEvent}. Our method enables each \gloss{EnvObj} of the scene to influence the environment locally, reducing the need of computations while also retrieving \glosses{EnvVal} locally, which result in a parallelizable life-like simulation process. The genericity of the environment properties definitions should be sufficient for plausible generation of other landscape types as long as expert knowledge can be translated to \gloss{EnvObj}'s formalism.


We limited our work to the use of 2D scalar fields as they are more easily differentiable, interpretable and lighter than volumetric representations. However, future works include using 3D representations of the terrain and the environment to generate 3D terrains, including cavities, sub-terrestrial areas and the interior of coral structures. 
% The different possibilities to explore for this would be: the use of 3D particles to represent the state of the \glosses{EnvMat} in the environment, or voxel grids or flatten representation of the terrain's surface (but would not allow a different morphological shape than the height field...).

% \section{Method}
% \label{sec:env-obj_method}
% The overall pipeline of the method is based on simple incremental generation like most rule-based systems. In this type of system, the final state is defined either by reaching equilibrium, or by verifying specific conditions, such as a maximum number of iterations. 
% We define our pipeline in three phases (\cref{fig:env-obj_pipeline}): the initialization phase that describe the generation and simulation rules, the iterative phase generating populating the terrain with our \glosses{EnvObj} and finally the output.


% \subsection{Pipeline overview}





















% \section{Expert knowledge integration}
% \label{sec:env-obj_biology}
%   The definition of the \glosses{FitnessFunc} of the \glosses{EnvObj} are inspired by the biological and geological factors that rule the evolution of underwater landscapes. The main factors are depth, light, water currents and biodiversity. External \glosses{GeoEvent} have direct and indirect repercussions on the biodiversity of underwater environments. Coral reef islands are complex bio systems in which fauna, flora and geology are mixed together. 

% \subsection{\Glosses{EnvObj} description}
% \label{sec:env-obj_represented-objects}
% We have represented with \glosses{EnvObj} some geologic features, animal features and flora features. The low island is most often raised in a circular shape as the process mainly appear around a hot spot under the ground. The evolution of an island into a coral reef island requires that the environmental conditions are sufficient for coral development: corals will grow slightly below the water surface as waves will break its growth and at a shallow depth (around 3m to 30m deep) in order for light to reach it. As coral grow and die, the skeleton is transformed into porous limestone, providing shelter to surrounding animals and reducing the impact of water erosion on the island. Corals drop polyps that are transported by the water flow and when they stick to a hard surface, as a rock or the reef itself, the coral may grow and colonize the area. As subsidence cause the island to lower, the living part of the coral reef keep growing toward light, which lead to a reef that is constantly close to the water level without reaching it due to wave erosion. The survival of reefs depends on the equilibrium between coral growth and and erosion. Eroded parts of the reef falling in the sheltered part of the reef accumulates, ending up by forming a lagoon. An island formed by a hot spot will inevitably subside in time, until it is completely flatten. As the coral reefs keep growing, only the lagoon remain, resulting in an atoll. \\
% In this work we we integrate the biological and geological knowledge in the \glosses{FitnessFunc} of the \glosses{EnvObj} we want to generate. We represent the islands as regions that can be appearing with a uniform distribution. From the formulation of the region description \eqref{eq:env-obj_snake-energy-equation}, we mostly create circular islands. The coral features, \glosses{EnvObj} described as a single point, have a \gloss{FitnessFunc} that take into account the depth of the ground, the amount of sand, fresh water and polyps in their environment, as well as the strength of water currents. Each coral species have different living conditions, but we reduced our work to soft coral which are sensible to water strength and stony corals that are more resistant to erosion. Reefs are formed as coral's skeleton are transformed into calcareous stone, describing then as an \gloss{EnvObj} representing multiple others. 

% \subsection{Simplifications}
% \label{sec:env-obj_simplifications}
% The environmental factors simulated are greatly simplified as the real processes are in a very small time scale, that computer simulation are not able to simulate in interactive time. The use of \glosses{EnvObj} aim to represent a plausible results, while avoiding modeling the smaller scale \glosses{GeoEvent}. Examples of simplifications are the geometry and material of each \gloss{EnvObj}, which have an influence on the water currents through friction, the water currents represented as stationary flows, while the water flow dynamics are a complex system that may change completely at two different times of the day, the animal influence on the reefs that they transform by the ingestion and deposition of sediments, ...
