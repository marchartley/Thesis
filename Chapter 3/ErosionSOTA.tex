\subsection{Erosion processes}
Driven by an array of natural forces and processes, erosion varies significantly across environments, from the intense carving of river valleys to the subtle reshaping of slopes in arctic regions. In this section, we present the primary types of erosion (thermal, hydraulic, and wind erosion) alongside other significant processes that contribute to landscape change. 
Each erosion type not only influences distinct terrain forms but also varies in applicability depending on terrain representation in simulations. Notably, not all erosion types are easily adaptable to all forms of terrain representation, due to inherent limitations in data resolution and computational methods.

    Gravity-driven erosion encompasses processes that involve the downslope movement of soil, rock, or debris due to the force of gravity. These processes, including landslides and talus slope formation, play a crucial role in reshaping landscapes by redistributing materials across slopes, valleys, and cliffs, influencing terrain stability and morphology.

    \subsubsubsection{Thermal erosion}
    % \wrapFig{freeze-thaw.jpg}{0.25}{fig:erosion-freeze_thaw}{Freeze-thaw process from \cite{Wang2017}}

    Freeze-thaw weathering, also known as frost wedging or frost shattering, is a process that occurs when water infiltrates cracks and pores within rocks and then freezes. As the water freezes, it expands and exerts pressure on the rock, causing it to fracture and break apart over time. This cycle of freezing and thawing is especially prevalent in regions with large temperature variations between day and night or between seasons, such as alpine and polar climates. Over time, freeze-thaw weathering contributes to the breakdown of large rocks into smaller fragments, creating loose rock material that can accumulate and gradually move downslope.

    Freeze-thaw weathering plays an important role in shaping landscapes, as it weakens rock faces and cliff edges, contributing to the formation of loose rock debris that eventually becomes part of other erosive processes, such as the development of talus slopes. This process, involving freeze-thaw cycles, can quickly fragment rock surfaces, with cumulative landscape impacts like the formation of talus slopes observable over decades to centuries.

\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Talus slopes}
    Talus slopes, also known as scree slopes, are accumulations of loose, angular rock debris at the base of cliffs, steep slopes, or mountainous areas. These slopes form as fragments of rock break off due to weathering processes like freeze-thaw and gravity pulls them downslope, where they accumulate in a cone-shaped deposit. Talus slopes are common in high-altitude or cold regions where physical weathering of rock faces is intense, and they contribute to the visual ruggedness of mountainous landscapes. Formed by the accumulation of rock debris from higher elevations, talus slopes develop gradually as materials accumulate, influencing terrain over centuries.
}{talus.png}{}{}

The procedural terrain generation domain blurres the definition of thermal erosion introduced by \cite{Musgrave1989} simplifying it to a material stabilization problem. 

\subsubsubsection{Landslides}
Landslides encompass a range of processes where rock, soil, or debris moves downslope due to gravity. These events vary in scale and speed, ranging from rapid, sudden rockfalls to slow, gradual soil creep. They can be triggered by factors such as heavy rainfall, seismic activity, or thawing permafrost, which destabilize slopes and initiate movement. Key types of landslides include:
\begin{Itemize}
    
    \Item{Rockfalls:} Sudden detachment of rock from steep faces, often triggered by weathering, freeze-thaw cycles, or seismic activity, leading to rapid downslope movement. 
    \Item{Soil creep:} Slow, continuous downslope movement of soil and rock, caused by repeated cycles of expansion and contraction due to changes in moisture and temperature, often imperceptible over short timescales.
    \Item{Mudflows and debris flows:} Rapid flows of water-saturated soil and debris, typically triggered by heavy rainfall or snowmelt, which transport large volumes of material downslope in a short period.
\end{Itemize}
    
Landslides are a major force in landscape evolution, rapidly reshaping terrain and redistributing materials across slopes and valleys.Triggered by factors like heavy rain or seismic activity, landslides can reshape landscapes almost instantaneously, though their frequency and impact may vary widely.

\smallConclusion

Realistic simulation of these effects can be achieved by applying multi-flow computational fluid dynamics on the internal rock fragments or sediments by considering them as fluid particles with an evaporating viscosity \cite{Feng2024,Harmon2001,Lenaerts2009} or as inelatical frictional spheres \cite{Walton1993} but at the cost of very high computation times.

In procedural terrain generation however, freeze-thaw, talus slopes and landslides are all considered the same manner and generalized as "thermal erosion". The use of "thermal erosion" or "thermal weathering" in procedural generation, introduced by \cite{Musgrave1989}, is a misnomer they initially used in opposition of "hydraulic erosion". However, the effect of freeze-thaw can be seen as a reduction in the ground resistance to detachment as the critical shear stress is highly reduced in cold weather regions, while the talus slopes and landslides are considering finer soil particles or the mixing of liquid fluids, introducing viscosity in the system, resulting in a quite similar output \cite{Hudak2011}.

Thermal erosion can be simulated by redistributing rock fragments or particles to accumulate at the base of cliffs or steep inclines, taking into account only the surface of the terrain. This effect can be achieved by applying gravity-based algorithms that allow loose materials to fall and settle, forming natural slopes of debris at the base of rocky terrain \cite{Musgrave1989,Jones2010}. Initially proposed for discrete height field terrain representations, the thermal erosion simulation proposed by \citep{Musgrave1989} and improved for GPUs by \cite{Jako2011} iteratively displace a small amount of the height at each cell of the terrain and redistribute it to its direct neighbors if a repose angle is not satisfied. \citep{Jones2010} adapts this definition of thermal erosion for density-voxels representations and \citep{Benes2001} for layered representation. The importance of keeping track of scree areas allows to model more details in them \cite{Peytavie2009a,Paris2020}. 



\subsubsection{Hydraulic erosion}
\begin{figure}

    \caption{Hydraulic erosion is tailored by the friction of water displacing sediments in a slope}
    \label{fig:erosion-hydraulic-erosion}
\end{figure}


Hydraulic erosion is the process by which moving water dislodges and transports soil, sediment, and rock from the Earth's surface. Occurring in multiple forms, including river-based, rainfall-induced, and coastal erosion, hydraulic erosion is driven by factors such as water velocity, volume, and surface composition. This process plays a primary role in reshaping landforms, forming valleys, river channels, and coastlines, and significantly contributes to sediment redistribution in terrestrial and coastal environments.

    \subsubsubsection{Fluvial erosion}
    % \wrapFigL{river_erosion.pdf}{0.25}{fig:erosion-river-erosion-profile}
    % {The erosion on the river bank is the combination of two processes: the detachment of the bottom of the sides, then the break of the upper coasts. }

    Fluvial erosion is the process by which rivers and streams reshape the landscape by eroding, transporting, and depositing sediment. This phenomenon occurs as the kinetic energy of moving water exerts mechanical forces on the riverbed and banks, dislodging soil, rock, and sediment particles. The intensity of fluvial erosion is influenced by factors such as water velocity, discharge (the volume of water flowing per unit time), channel slope, and the composition of the riverbed and banks.
}{river_erosion.pdf}{The erosion on the river bank is the combination of two processes: the detachment of the bottom of the sides, then the break of the upper coasts.}{fig:erosion-river-erosion-profile}

In steep, fast-flowing sections of a river, higher water velocities generate turbulent flow, which increases the river's capacity to dislodge and carry large particles. These particles, including gravel and pebbles, collide with the riverbed in a process called abrasion, grinding and wearing down the bedrock over time. Additionally, water exerts direct hydraulic pressure, especially in areas where currents are swift, prying apart rocks and sediment through hydraulic action. This is especially effective in widening channels and undercutting banks.

Fluvial erosion processes contribute to a dynamic reshaping of river channels, forming distinct landforms such as V-shaped valleys, canyons, and river meanders. Over time, rivers naturally balance their erosive energy with sediment transport and deposition, forming floodplains where sediment is deposited during seasonal overflows. In meandering rivers, erosion typically occurs on the outer curves of bends, where flow velocity is highest, while sediment deposition takes place on the inner curves, forming point bars. This continual interaction between erosion and deposition drives the lateral migration of meanders, altering the river's course across the landscape. The river's competence, or its ability to transport particles of a certain size, depends on the flow's velocity and discharge. During periods of high flow, such as after heavy rainfall or snowmelt, rivers gain greater erosive power, enabling them to transport larger particles and increase their erosion rates. River systems reshape landscapes methodically over years to millennia, deeply engraving river paths and altering regional topographies.


\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Rainfalls}
    % \wrapFig{rillsGullies.jpg}{0.25}{fig:erosion-rills_gullies}{From \cite{Geertsema2010}}
    Rainfall-induced hydraulic erosion begins as raindrops strike exposed soil surfaces, causing splash erosion, where particles are dislodged and displaced by the impact of individual raindrops, creating tiny craters \cite{Li2024,Valette2005}. As rainfall accumulates and flows overland, it transitions into sheet erosion, where a thin layer of water, known as sheet flow, moves across the land surface. This process is often intensified on sloped terrain, where the water gains momentum as it descends, picking up and carrying loose particles downslope. Sheet erosion can remove a uniform layer of soil across a large area, gradually depleting soil fertility and weakening the structure of the soil surface.
}{rillsGullies.jpg}{From \cite{Geertsema2010}}{fig:erosion-rills_gullies}

On steeper or more prolonged slopes, sheet flow may concentrate into small channels, initiating rill erosion \cite{Gatto2000}. Rills are narrow, shallow channels that cut into the soil as water flow converges, carving miniature stream-like paths down the slope. As rills deepen and widen, they can evolve into larger channels in a process called gully erosion. Gullies represent a more severe stage of erosion, where channels become deep and wide enough that normal agricultural or natural processes cannot easily repair them. Gullies disrupt the landscape, fragmenting ecosystems, and accelerating the removal of topsoil.

The extent of erosion depends on factors such as rainfall intensity and duration, soil type, vegetation cover, and slope steepness. Sandy soils, for instance, are more prone to erosion due to their low cohesion, whereas clay-rich soils, while more resistant to initial splash erosion, are highly susceptible to rill and gully formation once water begins to concentrate. Splash erosion and sheet erosion can cause significant soil degradation and landscape changes over months to decades.

\smallConclusion

Hydraulic erosion is the main focus of study in terms of erosion for terrain generation as its effects on the surface of terrains are visible on a large scale and are the most stable as we consider a constant amount of rain at every point.

In procedural terrain generation, fluvial erosion is focused on the generation of rivers and cascades defined as feature-curves \cite{Emilien2015}. Firstly, the path of the river is drawn either by the user \cite{Hnaidi2010} or through simulation \cite{ParisThesis}. Secondly, the shape of the rivers' bed are modeled \cite{Genevaux2013}. It is then finally possible to provide a geometric representation of the water surface to take into account flow rate, depth, obstacles and user-defined details \cite{Peytavie2019}.

The computation of rivers' properties are defined by understanding the flow of water which is directly related to the amount of rainfall at each point of the terrain \cite{Kelley1988} (at the time approximated by simplified Shallow water modeling \cite{Mei2007}) but is mainly achieved in acceptable computation time by considering all rivers as a drainage network, an oriented graph of rivers as introduced by \cite{Roudier1993}. Recent works focus on the acceleration of the computation of these graphs and the drainage area associated at each point \cite{Cordonnier2016,Schott2023}.

In most works, the amount of water falling at each point of the terrain can be taken into account. However, this strategy is divided in works that consider that rain fall uniformly on the whole terrain or using a random noise function, that rain is more present in regions of high altitude \cite{Neidhold2005}, or can use a more accurate weather simulation to define areas more proheminent to water falls \cite{Wojtek2022}.

As the motion of water is easier to model on the surface of the terrain, almost all algorithms consider the terrain with a 2.5D representation. On a large-scale, this assumption is beneficial but limits their scope to this type of representation, making them unavailable to volumetric models. Particle-based methods are then proposed to overcome this issue for smaller-scale terrains, using 3D Eulerian fluid simulations on voxel terrain representations \cite{Benes2006} or Lagrangian simulations on TIN terrains \cite{Kristof2009} at the expense of much higher computational time.

    \subsubsection{Chemical erosion and caves}

    Chemical erosion, also known as chemical weathering, involves the chemical reactions between water and rock that lead to the dissolution and alteration of minerals within the rock. This process is especially significant in river and coastal environments, where water, often containing dissolved carbon dioxide, interacts with rocks like limestone and dolostone to form weak carbonic acid. This acid reacts with carbonate minerals, gradually breaking down the rock structure through a process called dissolution. Over time, this breakdown weakens rock formations, making them more susceptible to mechanical erosion by water.
}{seaCaveArch.jpg}{By Steve Hillebrand/U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service}{fig:erosion-corrosion-erosion}

Chemical erosion is particularly influential in the formation of karst landscapes, where the dissolution of carbonate rocks creates unique features such as caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems. As acidic water seeps into fractures within the rock, it slowly enlarges these cracks, leading to the creation of hollow spaces and intricate cave networks. In addition to carbonic acid, other dissolved ions, such as sulfur and organic acids, can also contribute to the chemical weathering of rocks in various environments. The dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone forms extensive karst landscapes, including networks of underground caves, over thousands to millions of years.

% One of the most common ways caves form is through chemical erosion, particularly in landscapes with carbonate rocks, such as limestone and dolostone. This process, often referred to as karstification, occurs when acidic groundwater interacts with carbonate minerals. As carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or soil dissolves into rainwater, it forms weak carbonic acid, which then seeps into rock fractures. Over time, the acidic water dissolves the rock, enlarging fractures and creating extensive underground networks.

% This form of chemical erosion gives rise to karst caves, known for their complex formations, including stalactites and stalagmites formed by mineral deposits left behind by dripping water. Karst caves are some of the world's most intricate and expansive cave systems, with notable examples including Mammoth Cave in the United States and the Škocjan Caves in Slovenia.


% In coastal areas, chemical erosion works alongside mechanical processes to shape shoreline features. The saltwater in coastal environments can accelerate chemical weathering, especially in rocks rich in reactive minerals. This combined action of chemical and mechanical processes results in a dynamic coastal landscape that includes cliffs, sea arches, and tide pools. Over time, these chemical reactions weaken coastal rock formations, allowing wave action to further erode and shape the coastline.

Sea caves can form through the mechanical force of hydraulic action as waves continuously impact the shore. These sea caves develop along coastlines with cliffs, where wave energy focuses on weak points in the rock, such as fractures or softer rock layers. Over time, the pressure from waves and tides pries apart rock fragments, carving out hollow spaces within the cliffside. Formed by the erosive power of waves against rock cliffs containing zones of weakness, development can be observed over hundreds to thousands of years.

% This hydraulic action often works in conjunction with other processes, such as abrasion, where sediment carried by waves further grinds down the rock surfaces. Sea caves are commonly found in areas with high tidal energy, with examples like the Blue Grotto in Malta and the sea caves along California's coastline.

In desert environments, caves can also form through aeolian erosion, where wind-driven sand particles abrade rock surfaces. These aeolian caves are typically found in sandstone or other softer rocks, where strong, consistent winds gradually wear away the rock. Unlike chemical or hydraulic caves, aeolian caves are usually shallower and smaller, as the erosive force of wind is less powerful than water or acid-driven processes. However, these caves add unique features to desert landscapes, creating sheltered hollows that sometimes serve as habitats for desert wildlife. Created by wind erosion primarily in softer rock formations, these caves can develop over centuries, depending on the consistency and strength of wind.

% An example of aeolian caves can be seen in the Navajo Sandstone formations of the southwestern United States, where wind erosion has carved intricate cave-like recesses and arches.

\smallConclusion

In procedural terrain generation, chemical erosion has been rarely studied as this interaction mostly occurs in shallow to deep waters and require a volumetric representation, while most terrain generation algorithms are tailored to aerian landscapes and are limited by 2.5D representations. However, using 3D cellular automata can provide an explicit representation of this effect \cite{Menshutina2020} (and can be extended to a simulation of coastal erosion \cite{Hawick2014}). An approximation of this phenomena is proposed in \cite{Beardall2007,Jones2010} on voxel grids by considering that the most vulnerable voxels of the terrain are the ones who has the most neighbors with air voxels, in a very similar manner to the computation of voxel-grid ambiant occlusion. The simulation of sea caves for implicit terrains has been proposed by \cite{Paris2018} by considering a resistance function in the bedrock, usually function of height, and adding spherical holes in the construction tree at the least resistante areas of the terrain. The inverse percolation method enables the simulation to dig longer cavities, looking like coastal karsts.

The generation of complete karst networks has been studied in different domains, such as the hydrogeology, where the generation of conduits based on the hydrologic network and soil properties allowed to generate the first examples of karst systems \cite{Jaquet2004,Pardo2012,Pytel2015}. However, these methods allows no user control and the computation time is unfit for terrain generation. More recently, \cite{Paris2021} proposed to describe the karst network as a graph whose nodes are sampled points in the terrain and for which the shortest path (using soil resistance as metric) between each point provide the path of each tunnel of the network. An improved algorithm, with more geological parameters propose more geological plausibility \cite{Gouy2024}.

% \wrapFig{sandDunes.jpg}{0.25}{fig:erosion-sand-dunes}{Sand dunes, from \cite{Sun2006}}
Aeolian erosion, also known as wind erosion, is the process by which wind transports, dislodges, and deposits particles of soil, sand, and rock, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where vegetation is sparse. This form of erosion is driven by the movement of loose particles across the surface and the abrasive impact of wind-driven sand. Aeolian erosion leads to distinctive landforms that shape desert landscapes, coastal areas, and regions downwind of deserts. Wind erosion typically occurs through three main processes: deflation (the removal of fine particles), saltation (the bouncing movement of medium-sized particles), and abrasion (the wearing down of rock surfaces by wind-driven particles).

\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Sand dunes}
    One such feature is sand dunes, mounds or ridges of sand formed by the accumulation of wind-transported particles. As wind moves sand across a surface, obstacles such as rocks or vegetation can slow the particles, causing them to settle and accumulate into dunes. The shape and type of dune depend on wind direction, strength, sand availability, and landscape features. Common types of dunes include barchan dunes, which are crescent-shaped with tips pointing downwind, transverse dunes, long ridges perpendicular to the wind, and star dunes, which have multiple arms formed by shifting winds. These dunes are dynamic, migrating over time as wind continues to move sand particles, contributing to the constantly evolving desert landscape.

\AltTextImage{
    \subsubsubsection{Yardangs}
    Yardangs, another aeolian feature, are elongated ridges formed where softer material is eroded faster than more resistant rock. The wind-carved ridges align with the prevailing wind direction, creating streamlined shapes with steep sides facing into the wind and gentler slopes on the leeward side. Yardangs vary widely in size, from small ridges a few meters long to massive formations stretching for kilometers, as seen in desert regions of Iran and Egypt. They illustrate the power of wind erosion in shaping landscapes over long periods, with their formation largely dependent on rock hardness, wind intensity, and particle size. These streamlined rock formations are carved by persistent wind eroding softer material faster than harder material, typically forming over centuries.

    \subsubsubsection{Ventifacts}
    Ventifacts are rocks that have been shaped and polished by the abrasive action of wind-driven sand. These rocks typically exhibit flat, smooth surfaces that are often oriented in the same direction as the prevailing winds. Their formation occurs predominantly in arid environments where loose sand is available to act as a natural sandblasting tool. This erosive process highlights the power of wind as a geomorphic agent, capable of sculpting rocks into distinctive shapes over time. Rocks shaped by wind-driven sand, ventifacts can take decades to centuries to form, depending on local wind conditions and rock exposure.

\smallConclusion

Wind erosion shifts material through wind force, notably impacting areas with fine surface particles like deserts. 
Sand dunes generation has been modeled on discrete height fields \cite{Roa2004} by mimicking sand's wind-driven trajectory and using thermal erosion for correcting the slope. These algorithms consider the wind coming from a unique direction, but as we include a little more complexity in the wind simulation, new dunes formations can emerge. \cite{Paris2019b}, adapted for layer-based representations, in which the layers of sand and the layers of bedrock are defined includes the definition of a wind simulation consisting of warping a uniform flow with the terrain slopes, which allows for the fast generation of large-scale desertic landscapes. More recently, \cite{Rosset2024} associated a fine resolution 3D fluid simulation for wind simulation, enabling to simulate dunes formation at a small scale with high fidelity for a cost in computation time due to fluid dynamics. 

While the presented method take into account the effect of an obstacle on a grain of sand, none consider the effect of the sand on obstacles. For the same reasons as the simulation of chemical erosion, the abrasive factor of sand and wind are left behind. The formation of yardangs have not been studied at the best of my knowledge. Althought not exactly targeted to ventifacts, but at the generation of hoodoos, \cite{Beardall2007} and \cite{Jones2010} propose a density-voxel based method for computing the weathering of rocks while taking the voxel exposition to air and resistance into account. The inclusion of an additional force field for computing the displacement of the detached matter could be the only missing feature for ventifact generation.

In multiple works, the simulation of sand and snow interchangeable as we consider them as small particle whose density varies slightly.

\subsubsection{Glacial erosion}
Glacial erosion is a dominant geomorphic force in cold regions, characterized by massive ice sheets and glaciers that sculpt the Earth's surface over thousands of years. As glaciers advance and retreat, they transform landscapes through two primary mechanisms: plucking and abrasion.

Plucking occurs when glaciers freeze to the bedrock and, as they move, exert tremendous force that tears away blocks of rock. This process is facilitated by water that infiltrates cracks in the rock, freezes, and expands, helping to dislodge rock pieces as the glacier flows. Abrasion happens concurrently as rocks and debris embedded in the ice act like sandpaper, grinding and smoothing the rock surface beneath the glacier. This abrasion not only polishes the rock but also carves deep grooves and striations, linear marks that align with the direction of ice movement.

These erosive processes give rise to distinctive glacial landforms. U-shaped valleys, unlike the V-shaped valleys formed by river erosion, are wide and deep with a flat bottom, shaped by the broad, sweeping movement of glacier ice. Fjords are deep, narrow inlets of the sea set between high cliffs, created by the deepening of U-shaped valleys by glaciers that then become submerged as sea levels rise. Cirques are amphitheater-like hollows situated at the heads of glacial valleys, formed by the erosion caused by the rotational movement of ice within them. Moraines are accumulations of dirt and rocks scraped up and deposited by moving glaciers, typically appearing as ridges along the sides of glaciers or as mounds of debris left behind after a glacier retreats.

The timescale of glacial processes is vast, often spanning thousands to millions of years, allowing glaciers to leave a lasting impact on the landscape.

Few works have been focusing their effort on the understanding and modeling of glacial erosion phenomena. In this conditions, \cite{Argudo2020} consider the glacier as a fluid with no inertia, called the Shallow-ice approximation, taking only the terrain surface gradient and ice thinkness to deduce the velocity of an ice column. The shear stress applied beneath the ice sheet is directly computed by the estimation of the ice column and its velocity. This method results in V-shape valleys, but when integrating more factors in the simulation, such as debris flow, fluvial erosion and talus slopes, the improved method presented in \cite{Cordonnier2023} generates a large variety of features present in glacial landscapes.

% \subsubsection{Tectonic activity}
% Tectonic forces are fundamental in shaping the Earth's surface. They drive the creation of dramatic landscapes and influence ecological and climatic systems through processes such as uplift, faulting and subsidence.

% Uplift occurs as a result of tectonic plates colliding or one plate being forced beneath another at convergent boundaries, or through the upwelling of magma at divergent boundaries. This geological process leads over millions of years to the creation of mountain ranges.
% %  elevate extensive plateaus, which influence climate patterns by altering wind and moisture circulation across large areas.

% Faulting occurs when stress in the Earth's crust exceeds the strength of rocks, causing them to fracture and slip along faults. This process can create significant topographical features like rift valleys and escarpments. For example, the East African Rift is a result of tectonic stretching that is pulling the African plate apart, forming a series of rift valleys. Fault movements can be gradual, occurring over millions of years, or sudden, as seen in earthquake events.

% % Tectonic activity deeply influences river systems by altering the topography through which rivers flow. Uplift can change a river's gradient, accelerating erosion processes as the river carves deeper into the bedrock, creating V-shaped valleys and canyons. An example of this is the Colorado River, which has carved the Grand Canyon over millions of years due to the uplift of the Colorado Plateau.

% Tectonic subsidence can lead to the formation of river deltas and floodplains as land areas sink, allowing rivers to deposit more sediment. This process can create fertile agricultural regions but may also increase flood risks. The Mississippi River Delta is an example where subsidence has led to significant changes in land forms and challenges due to rising sea levels and sinking land. This gradual sinking can occur over thousands to millions of years.

% % Subsidence occurs both due to the lithospheric stretching at divergent boundaries and the sedimentary loading in basins previously uplifted by tectonics. As these basins form, they often become depositional environments collecting sediments that can later turn into sedimentary rock layers rich in fossils, providing important geological records. The Great Basin in the USA is an example of a region experiencing ongoing subsidence, contributing to its complex geological structure.

% % Basin formation also has significant implications for hydrocarbon reservoirs as many of the world's oil and gas deposits are found in these structures. Sedimentary basins like the Persian Gulf Basin have become focal points for energy resources due to their extensive oil and natural gas deposits formed from organic matter buried under layers of sediment.

\subsubsection{Volcanic activity}
Volcanic activity is a powerful tectonic process that alters landscapes by creating new landforms through the eruption of magma from the Earth's mantle \cite{Ramalho2013}. Volcanoes form primarily at tectonic boundary zones either where plates diverge, allowing magma to rise and fill the gaps, or where one plate subducts beneath another, melting into magma due to high pressure and temperature.

The surface changes wrought by volcanic activity are profound and varied. When a volcano erupts, it can deposit layers of lava that solidify into new rock formations, gradually building the volcanic cones and mountainous structures that are characteristic of volcanic islands and mountain ranges \cite{Woodroffe2003}. % For example, the formation of the Hawaiian Islands is the result of repeated eruptions of volcanoes, which have created high volcanic islands from the ocean floor for nearly a hundred million years.

% In addition to lava flows, volcanoes can emit vast amounts of tephra-fragments of rock and solidified lava ejected into the air. The accumulation of tephra can bury landscapes, altering topography rapidly and contributing to the slope instability of the terrain. Over time, tephra layers can consolidate into tuff, a rock type that forms a significant component of some volcanic landscapes.
\AltTextImage{
    Pyroclastic flows are another aspect of volcanic activity that dramatically changes the terrain. These fast-moving currents of hot gas and volcanic matter can race down the sides of a volcano, destroying everything in their path and laying down thick deposits that can form natural barriers or change drainage patterns by damming rivers and creating lakes almost instantaneously.

    Volcanic activity can also lead to the formation of calderas, large depressions that occur when the summit of a volcano collapses into the emptied magma chamber below after an eruption. Calderas can be several kilometers in diameter and significantly alter the local landscape.

\subsubsection{Biological processes}
Biological processes play a crucial role in shaping terrestrial and aquatic environments through mechanisms that either promote or inhibit erosion. Known collectively as bioerosion, the activities of various organisms can have profound impacts on the stability and durability of habitats.

\subsubsubsection{Animals}
In terrestrial ecosystems, numerous animals contribute to erosion. Burrowing animals, such as rodents, moles, and earthworms, play a significant role by disturbing soil structures. Their burrowing actions create tunnels and voids in the soil, increasing porosity and altering water infiltration rates, which can accelerate soil erosion under certain conditions. These disturbances also bring subsurface soils to the surface, making them more vulnerable to wind and water erosion. 

Grazing animals including deer, cattle, and sheep can have dual effects on the landscape. By grazing, these animals reduce vegetation cover, which can increase the soil's exposure to erosive forces such as rain splash and surface runoff. Additionally, their trampling compacts the soil, reducing its porosity and permeability, which increases runoff and potential erosion.

Very few works have been focused on the effects of desire paths from human trailing and vehicule paths \cite{Cordonnier2018,Jaiswal2019}, human footsteps \cite{Alvarado2024} or animal paths \cite{Ecormier-Nocca2021} as the resulting spatial scale may become very small in comparison to other types of erosion.

In coastal and marine environments, bioerosion is a significant force affecting rocky shores and coral reefs. Organisms such as barnacles, sea urchins, and various mollusks attach to rocks and coral structures, physically breaking down these materials as they feed. Parrotfish, for example, erode coral structures by scraping off coral polyps to ingest the algae living on them. Over years, this contributes to the gradual wearing down of coral reefs, influencing the structural complexity and ecological dynamics of these habitats.

\subsubsubsection{Vegetation}
Vegetation profoundly influences erosion control, hydrological cycles, and soil stability across diverse landscapes. The mechanisms through which plants impact erosion are varied and complex, ranging from the stabilization provided by root systems to the protection offered by canopy cover.

Root systems form the foundation of soil stability. Deep-rooted plants like many trees and shrubs secure themselves deep within the soil, anchoring it firmly and preventing landslides and soil slips on slopes. These roots extend into subsoil layers, binding the soil particles together and maintaining the integrity of the slope beneath the surface. In contrast, grasses with fibrous root systems spread a dense network of fine roots through the topsoil, effectively creating a mat that holds the soil in place. This root mat not only prevents topsoil erosion but also enhances soil structure, promoting water infiltration and reducing runoff.

The canopy of vegetation acts as a first line of defense against the erosive force of rain. By intercepting raindrops, tree canopies distribute the water's impact over a wider area and decrease the velocity at which water hits the ground. This dispersion reduces the kinetic energy of raindrops, which lessens their ability to dislodge soil particles. Beneath the main canopy, smaller shrubs and herbaceous plants catch residual droplets, providing a secondary layer of protection that minimizes splash erosion and soil displacement.

The presence of vegetative cover significantly modifies surface runoff dynamics. Dense plant life adds physical barriers that increase the land's surface roughness and impede the flow of runoff water. This roughness slows down water movement, allowing more time for the water to seep into the soil rather than washing it away. Additionally, the process of transpiration, where plants absorb water from the ground and release it into the atmosphere, reduces the soil's moisture level, thereby increasing its capacity to absorb further rainfall. This cycle plays a critical role in maintaining soil hydration balance and reducing the volume of runoff during precipitation events.

\midConclusion

As we can see, many different erosion processes can occur on terrains over very different timescales. However, each procedural generation algorithms are mimicking a small amount of these processes at once. The choice of the terrain representation is a limiting factor in the possibilities offered to the developer. We can however see that most of the erosion processes are very similar and are composed of three main steps, even if their name differ depending on the phenomenon: the detachment of matter, its displacement, and the deposition in smaller sediments. The displacement is guided by the environment in which the erosion occurs. It may be only the force of gravity, the water flow, the wind or the trajectories of glaciers.
