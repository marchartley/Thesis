In this chapter, we present a novel particle-based method for simulating erosion on various terrain representations, including height fields, voxel grids, material layers, and implicit terrains. Our approach breaks down erosion into two key processes - terrain alteration and material transport - allowing for flexibility in simulation. We utilize independent particles governed by basic particle physics principles, enabling efficient parallel computation. For increased precision, a vector field can adjust particle speed, adaptable for realistic fluid simulations or user-defined control. We address material alteration in 3D terrains with a set of equations applicable across diverse models, requiring only per-particle specifications for size, density, coefficient of restitution, and sediment capacity. Our modular algorithm is versatile for real-time and offline use, suitable for both 2.5D and 3D terrains.
