\section{3D grids}
- In this manuscript, all 3D grids are defined as signed float32. \\
- Not optimal, especially for representing binary voxels (uses 32x more memory and computation than necessary), but flexible... \\
- Voxel grids stored as lists of sub-grids ("local modifications") to navigate undo-redo. Cell evaluation by summing sub-grids. \\
