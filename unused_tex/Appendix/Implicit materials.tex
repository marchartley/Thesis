\label{sec:state-of-the-art_implicit-terrain-with-materials}
- Volumetric modeling is important for representing 3D structures \\
- Allows for the representation of cavities, arches, overlays, etc. \\
- The concept of materials allows for including much more information for the following parts: enhancement and rendering \\
** Enhancement (e.g., erosion) needs to know the type of soil at the surface and subsurface to be realistic \\
** Rendering needs to know the material at the surface to correctly display textures \\
